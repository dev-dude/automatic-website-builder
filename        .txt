     Maybe you really truly dont care if malicious software attacks your computer or enlists it in a Distributed Denial of Service attack Ill just wipe it if I have to you say But its not just about you A recent study showed a kind of herd immunity effect In countries where a higher percentage of the population used antivirus even the unprotected ones fared better So be a good citizen and do your part If you dont want to pay for a premium antivirus utility pick one of the free antivirus products that weve rounded up for you  

     Quite a few of these products are free only for noncommercial use if you want to protect your business you have to pony up for the paid edition At that point you should probably consider upgrading to a full security suite After all its your businesss security on the line And if youve grown beyond SMB status investing in a SaaS endpoint protection system will let you monitor and manage security across your entire organization  

     Yes its true that Windows 8 and Windows 10 have antivirus built right in but in our tests and most independent lab tests Windows Defender hasnt done very well There have been some signs of improvement in recent tests which is encouraging  

     Your antivirus should definitely have the ability to root out existing malware but its ongoing task is to prevent ransomware botnets Trojans and other types of nasty programs from getting a foothold All of the antivirus programs in this collection offer realtime protection against malware attack Some take the fight upstream working hard to ensure you never even browse to a malwarehosting site or get fooled into turning over your credentials to a phishing site  

     Independent Antivirus Lab Test Results Around the world researchers at independent antivirus testing labs spend their days putting antivirus tools to the test Some of these labs regularly release public reports on their findings I follow six such labs closely AVComparatives AVTest Institute Dennis Technology Labs ICSA Labs Virus Bulletin and West Coast Labs  

     Security companies typically pay for the privilege of being included in testing In return the labs supply them with detailed reports that can help improve their products The number of labs that include a particular vendor serves as a measure of significance In each case the lab considered the product important enough to test and the vendor felt the price was worthwhile The labs dont necessarily test a vendors free product but most vendors pack full protection into the free product enhancing premium versions with additional features Ive worked out a system for aggregating lab results yielding a lab score from 0 to 5 or NA if there just isnt enough data  

     Since I use the same samples month after month the malwareblocking test definitely doesnt measure a products ability to detect brandnew threats In a separate test I attempt to download malware from 100 very new malicious URLs supplied by MRGEffitas typically less than a day old I note whether the antivirus blocked all access to the URL wiped out the malicious payload during download or did nothing McAfee and Symantec both paid products hold the very best scores in this test though some free antivirus utilities have done fairly well  

     Useful Features Just about every antivirus product scans files on access to make sure malware cant launch and also scans the entire system on demand or on a schedule you set The one exception in the current collection is a tool aimed very specifically at detecting attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system or applications That tool Malwarebytes AntiExploit Free is designed for use in conjunction with a regular antivirus  

     Blocking all access to malwarehosting URLs is a nice way to avoid trouble Many products extend that protection to also steer users away from fraudulent websites phishing sites that try to steal login credentials for financial sites and other sensitive sites A few rate links in search results flagging any dangerous or iffy ones  

     Behaviorbased detection a feature of some antivirus products is a twoedged sword On the one hand it can detect malware thats never been seen before On the other hand if its not done right it can baffle the user with messages about perfectly legitimate programs  

     One easy way to keep your PC protected is to install all security updates both for Windows and for browsers and other popular applications Starting with Windows 10 Windows updates arent optional for consumers but there are plenty of security holes in popular apps and addons Scanning for vulnerabilities in the form of missing updates is a feature most often found in commercial antivirus products but it does turn up in some free ones In the chart above you can see which products include these useful features  

     Whats Not Here This article reports only on free antivirus products that received at least a good rating in our reviewsthree stars or better Among those that didnt make the cut is Microsoft Security Essentials  Windows Defender All of the independent labs I follow do include Microsoft in testing but most use it as a baseline If a product cant do better than the baseline its got real problems There may be hope though In the latest report from AVTest Microsoft earned a decent 14 of 18 possible points much better than its previous failing grade of 95 points And Dennis Labs awarded Microsoft AAA certification its highest rating  

     There are also numerous free antivirus utilities that work solely to clean up existing malware infestations You bring out these cleanuponly tools when you have a nasty malware infestation When the problems gone they have no further use since they offer no ongoing protection Our Editors Choice in this category is Malwarebytes AntiMalware 20 and its definitely one you should try if youve got a malware problem But since theyre free you can keep trying others if the first one doesnt do the job When the scare is over youll need a fullblown antivirus for ongoing protection  

     Whats Best Our current Editors Choice products for free antivirus utility are Avast Free Antivirus AVG AntiVirus Free and Panda Free Antivirus All three get very good scores from the independent labs and in our own tests as well All three include some useful bonus features Avast in particular packs a password manager and a network security scanner in its toolkit If you do have a little cash in your budget for security the best paid antivirus products do tend to offer more and better protection If not try a few of these free tools and see which one you like best  

    For Windows PC users a good antivirus program is a necessity to ward off malware attacks keep your computer running efficiently and safeguard your online identity and personal information Premium antivirus suites have additional features to protect you from malicious Web pages help you manage security on mobile devices and monitor your computers firewall software updates and other features But some just dont want to  or cant  pay a yearly subscription fee for those extra features  

    So which free PC antivirus product is right for you We reviewed Avira Free Antivirus Malwarebytes AntiMalware Free Avast Free Antivirus AVG Antivirus Free and Microsoft Windows Defender Each was tested on the same Windows 8 Acer Aspire E1 laptop which featured a Core i3 processor and 4 GB of RAM 

Our malwaredetection data comes primarily from independent German evaluation lab AVTEST which regularly tests all major security software for the ability to detect zeroday malware and other threats     We also conducted our own tests on how each security suite affected a laptops performance running the PCMark7 benchmark software and our own OpenOffice productivity test to assess the systems baseline We ran the tests again while each security product did a quick malware scan and then again during full system scans and compared the results  

    Ease of use is also important which is why we assessed each program on its user interface and also on how insistently it nags you to upgrade from the free version to a paid edition from the same company 

     Editors choice Avira Free Antivirus Best Free Overall PC Antivirus 810 Totally worth it Review Download Now According to AVTEST Avira offers the strongest protection against both widespread and zeroday malware Its austere interface can be intimidating at first and computers with less RAM might see a performance impact However Avira Free Antivirus sheer effectiveness and good range of features  including a mobile portal and childsafety settings  make it the best choice

     Avast Free Antivirus Best Free PC Antivirus User Interface 710 Very good Review Download Now We liked Avast Free Antivirus for its friendly interface good performance and unique if relatively sophisticated set of features Its a good dependable program but it just wasnt the best in this roundup either in terms of antivirus protection or extra features However you may want to consider Avast Free Antivirus if you already use other Avast products such as Avast Free Mobile Security for Android our top choice in that category  

    We liked Avast Free Antivirus for its friendly interface good performance and unique if relatively sophisticated set of features Its a good dependable program but it just wasnt the best in this roundup either in terms of antivirus protection or extra features However you may want to consider Avast Free Antivirus if you already use other Avast products such as Avast Free Mobile Security for Android our top choice in that category  

    So if you no longer want to pay for the privilege of protecting your valuable piece of hardware read on  weve picked out four of the best free antivirus engines two top Android apps and two online detection services all delivering great security at no cost 

    If youre looking for a standalone antivirus package then 360 Total Security might seem a little overweight It provides antiphishing support online shopping protection network threat blocking hard drive cleanup tools a Windows update checker and more 

    Still what makes the suite interesting is that it uses no less than five antivirus engines Install it and you can be protected by Bitdefender technology an excellent commercial engine Avira probably the best of the free offerings and three further engines of Qihoos own 

    We found the multiengine approach can affect performance too with 360 Total Security taking anything up to twice as long to scan our system as some of the competition as well as returning more false positives 

    360 Total Security is far from perfect and if youre looking for a simple antivirus engine to run alongside other security tools then itll probably be too much But if detection rates are your top priority then the package is a real contender 

    While free antivirus software wont cost you anything to download you might sometimes find youll pay in other ways Install Avast Free Antivirus and itll also equip your PC with Google toolbar unless youre paying attention and clear the relevant checkbox 

    Scan your system for malware and by default Avast Free Antivirus also checks for junk files unnecessary apps and other performance issues although it wont fix any of these unless you buy the companys PC Optimizer 

    Fortunately you dont have to live with this Avast Free Antivirus has an excellent interface  its clean clear and configurable  and in just a few clicks you can set it up to avoid the timewasting performance scan 

    Some security companies spend a great deal of time and effort on interface design but Avira isnt quite so concerned Sure Avira Free Antivirus adds a graphical launcher to your system tray but the core program looks plain ordinary and a little dated 

    The program is loved by the testing labs Whether you check out AVTest AVComparatives or VB100 reports Avira technology almost always scores very highly And thats not only in relation to free software AVComparatives July 2015 RealWorld Protection Test ranked the program fourth out of 20 mostly commercial contenders with its 997 protection rate comparable with the highlyrated Bitdefender 998 and Kaspersky 997 Thats a typical score not a fluke  sometimes Avira tops the list 

    If youre looking for an easy life then you can leave the program alone and itll do its work almost entirely automatically But expert users get plenty of fine control  there are options to protect the Hosts file block autorun scan archives monitor network drives set the file types to be scanned even password protect your Avira installation so others cant mess with your settings 

    Avira Free Antivirus has a distinct shortage of bonus extras which might be an issue for some The Firewall options add little they configure the standard Windows firewall rather than adding anything new and even basic web protection requires a separate browser extension 

    Still for us Aviras strippedback design is a plus as it makes it easier to add other security tools without conflicts Factor in its many configuration options and Avira is a smart choice for more experienced users 

    Theres no doubt about its accuracy either AVComparatives monthly RealWorld Protection Test has seen Panda in the top two for months now trampling all over the commercial competition And independent testing shows it manages this while raising very few false alarms 

    Bonus extras include USB Protection to keep your USB keys safe from some malware while Process Monitor is a Task Managerlike tool displaying running processes their open HTTP connections and highlighting likely dangers 

    If youre feeling picky and spend long enough exploring the program you might find one or two minor issues Scanning speeds were marginally below average in our tests for instance and the program isnt as configurable as some of the competition 

    Its hard to complain about a package which gives you marketleading protection at zero cost though If youre looking for something simple and reliable which you can install and just leave to do its job then Panda Free Antivirus is a great choice 

    Selecting the best free Android antivirus app is difficult at the moment Its a very competitive market and the independent testing labs consistently show theres very little between the leading products 

    Avira Antivirus Security earns our vote for its consistency Its a reliable engine typically amongst the toprated apps at AVTest and AV Comparatives and its 44 star rated at Google Play and Aviras excellent record with PC security software makes us think youll be able to trust the product over the long term 

    There are plenty of bonus features too Antitheft tools can locate a lost phone trigger a siren or remotely lock or wipe a device and privacy ratings give you an indication of how apps are handling your data plus you also get identity protection app locking call filtering and more 

    Browsing protection hourly updates and tech support are reserved for the commercial Pro version only but Avira Antivirus Security provides the core essentials you need and does a great job of keeping you safe 

    360 Security  Antivirus FREE is one of the most popular antivirus apps around and the name alone gives you one reason why it really is free Okay you get ads but there are no upgrade buttons or limitations to the protection you get 

    Were particularly interested in the antivirus and 360 Security  Antivirus FREE delivers there too Its an extremely accurate engine which doesnt generate too much traffic significantly drain the battery or otherwise get in the way of your regular activities 

Installing a good antivirus engine will keep you safe from most threats but no product offers a 100 detection guarantee Even if a download hasnt raised an alert you might sometimes wonder if its safe    Upload a suspect file to VirusTotal and within seconds youll see the scanning results from 56 leading antivirus packages along with an indepth analysis of the file and even what it does when run on your computer the modules it needs the files it reads and writes and more 

    One problem with this multiproduct approach is youll regularly see false positives where most of the engines say a file is safe but a few flag it as dangerous If only a small number of packages raise alerts maybe five or less and the most trusted engines say its safe we might run the file anyway  but that does increase your risk of infection Wait a day or two and try scanning the file again if youre concerned 

    MetaScan Online uses fewer engines than VirusTotal  43 as opposed to 56  but thats not necessarily a bad thing Dropping the weaker products should mean fewer false positives and we also found reports were generated far more quickly 

    MetaScan Online can also scan marginally larger files than VirusTotal 140MB compared to 128MB and has a neat Scan History page to show how a files detection rate has changed over time But balancing that it doesnt provide any behavioural information and malware doesnt normally arrive in such large files anyway 

     A better interface This years version gets a row of icons at the top with intuitive images and labels which animate when you hover over them to help you see that youve selected them Clicking each icon drops down a submenu so you can browse all of them before making a move If you get lost just click the home icon thats always in the upper left to return you to the main menu  

     Lots of optional settings Overall you have a fine degree of control over how Avast behaves Clicking the gear icon on the far right takes you to Avast Free Antiviruss settings window which has categories in the lefthand pane and options for each category on the right Clicking Active Protection shows you a submenu that breaks down file protection email protection and browser protection into three subcategories Each of the three has a toggle to disable the whole element which is handy when you already have other software installed that you prefer for one of those three roles Click Customize to drill down into another set of categories and options specific to that role  

     Free syncing password manager Tools bundled with antimalware suites range widely in utility and quality and the free suites rarely include a password manager However the one in Avast is pretty respectable It provides extensions for Firefox and Chrome which you can use to autofill your login information at websites You create a master password that protects your list of individual site passwords and you can also sync your list across devices This requires you to create an account but its free You can also import passwords stored by your browser Avast doesnt make it clear if its list is encrypted and the password manager doesnt have many settings to customize its behavior but if you dont have a password manager this is a decent entry point  

     To sync with Android and iOS devices you need a different app named Avast Passwords available for free at the Google Play store and iTunes App Store The Android version of Avasts security software doesnt bundle the manager and there is no iOS version of Avast Mobile Security You can also subscribe to a premium version of the password manager that lets you transmit your login info from your mobile device to your computer if they are on the same WiFi network by tapping a button on your screen This feature costs a modest 10 a year  

     Streamlined system software updater Avast Free Antivirus can quickly scan your computer for outdated software and updating is integrated into the apps interface It creates a list of programs that need to be updated and you need only click the button next to the programs name to get the latest version Avast noticed that Java was outofdate on our device a problem that can create serious security holes Because of Avast Free Antiviruss update integration we didnt have to go to the Java website and hunt down the correct pages and links This might not be important for advanced users but it also wont get in their way because the update scan is optional and doesnt hound you to use it  

     VPN service overstates its abilities When you log in to the sevenday VPN trial Avast Free Antivirus tells you Your Internet activity is now completely invisible so nobody can spy on you but that isnt necessarily true Your Internet service provider can still detect that youre connecting to a VPN and someone can monitor the VPNs exit point back onto the public Internet and keep logs of that activity And a VPN doesnt necessarily protect you when you transmit personally identifiable information while using it nor does it protect you from malware that may already be on your computer recording what you type or which websites you access  

     According to AVTest and AVComparatives Avasts antivirus engine is relatively fast and accurate without bogging your system down making it one of the best free antivirus apps around And the password manager has cloud syncing across Windows iOS and Android devices a feature that the other managers would usually make you pay for But it would be better if the free and premium components were more clearly distinguished  

 December 28 2015  By BigBadWolf_2009  20151228 082145  By BigBadWolf_2009     Ive been using Avast exclusively for the past 5 or 6 years and have never had a problem  it runs all the time and if you go to open a site or an attachment that isnt safe it will pop up and warn you  this is an unbelievable service for Free 

    Ive been an Avast fan for years  and Ive used it on everything from XPs  to Vistas  and its on both my current WIndows 10s  I even have it on my Android tablet 
Truly its the best product out there  before Avast I used a few of the other top free brands but they never protected me like Avast does  just set it and forget it  if you go to a bad spot it will let you know 
I run scans a few times a week and Avast has kept me clean  it even has scans to catch browser add ons and one for security  this is a rock solid 5 Star program 
Get it youll love it

Was this review helpful 0 0  December 22 2015  By Alex Schwab  20151222 190606  By Alex Schwab     After buying a new computer I attempted to transfer the license over and the software wouldnt let me I purchased the package for 3 computers I called Avasts helpline and told them what was going on and they sent me another copy of my license it still didnt work After that I called them and the phone line was disconnected I emailed them again two days later and still havent received a response 

    I sent a ticket after the first attempt didnt work and never got a response I waited two days and tried calling their number but IT WAS CHANGED I tried another number but it required some passcode or something that I didnt have I looked for another number but didnt have any luck So I sent another ticket I didnt receive a response for this ticket either I also told them in the second ticket that I would like a refund for the VPN service because it slowed my internet down to around 110 of its usual strength from 100Mbps down to 812 Mbps sometimes a little more but there was a very noticeable difference All Im saying is that I think Avast is going downhill with their customer service and I will not be buyingrecommending their products I also have a feeling a lot more people will have the same experience as me due to the changing of phone numbers and lack of response from multiple tickets I was cheated out of a lot of money because I now only have the Avast Free Version 

Was this review helpful 0 0     Antivirus software provides an essential layer of protection from viruses trojans worms spyware adware dialers keyloggers and rootkits However dont let the name antivirus confuse you These days every good antivirus has good detection rates for all forms of malware not just viruses The term malware includes viruses trojans worms spyware adware dialers keyloggers rootkits and any other software which performs malicious activities on a computer 

    Sadly the amount of malware currently in circulation is so large that no antivirus could possibly detect all of it Despite vendors claims no single antivirus solution can detect nearly all new malware There are some products out there including some in this review which include technologies which are able to adequately protect a computer but any product which relies mainly on detection is statistically doomed to fail eventually Also using more than one realtime antivirus at the same time uses much more system resources can cause system errors and can even reduce protection due to unintended conflicts For my advice on how to compensate for these weakness of antivirus products please see my other article about How to Stay Safe While Online Having a good antivirus product does go a large way towards adequately protecting your computer but in this day I would highly recommend that you add additional layers to your security arsenal 

    Below I have reviewed some of the most effective Free Antivirus products currently on the market In order to make this review more unbiased although I do of course admit that my own intuition and experience does affect my judgment as well I came up with a particular methodology for comparing these products This methodology is described in the following section 

    The main motivation behind why I came up with this particular methodology for this review is that I value system protection against real world threats above all other categories by which an antivirus is commonly judged It does not matter to me whether an antivirus protects the user by detecting malware blocking dangerous sites behavioral analysis sandboxing or any other approach The most important thing is that at the end of the day your system is safe from infection Thus that is the attitude I have taken towards reviewing these products My criteria is entirely based on protection not cleaning Therefore if you believe your computer may be infected please first see my article on How to Know If Your Computer Is Infected before continuing to read the rest of this article 

    I have located reputable Antivirus testing organizations which claim to test products against situations which resemble realworld situations I narrowed these down by further requiring that the organizations have a relatively long record of producing good seemingly unbiased results The organizations I ended up with and therefore used for this review are 

    From here I looked at all tests spanning back over the last two years However if there were more than three tests within that range I used only the most recent three Also if given the choice between results from different operating systems I chose that for the most popular operating system At the moment Windows 7 is the most popular operating system 

    Also I only considered results if it was specifically the Free Version which was tested This is because the results for the Paid Version of the products in this review with the exception of Comodo Antivirus which has the exact same protection for its Free and Paid versions are often quite different from those for the Free versions Many marketing teams try to cloud this difference but for the purposes of getting the most reliable information I am strict about this Unless it can be explicitly proven that every protection mechanism is exactly identical to the free version the results for paid products are not considered in this analysis 

    In addition I did not count it against any of the products if they were not tested by multiple organizations As long as they were tested by at least one within the abovementioned period they were considered This criteria was chosen because there are many reasons to choose not to participate in a test Thus it should not be held against the product if they were not tested by multiple agencies However if they were not tested by any this makes it impossible to compare them in an unbiased fashion 

    Once this data was collected I then looked at the overall results for the Free Antivirus products discussed in this review and ordered them mainly according to the quantitative results However my own knowledge of the products and the reviews and experiences of others were also considered The results are presented and discussed below 

    Comodo Antivirus is my top pick for advanced users or for Intermediate users who are okay with an antivirus software which will occasionally ask them for input However if you do not fall into those categories or for any other reason find it to not be a good fit for you then you will likely find my next pick suitable Also for those who prefer a complete solution there is always Comodo Internet Security CIS which is also free and includes a firewall in addition to all other components which already come with Comodo Antivirus 

    Firstly I will note that I am a volunteer moderator not employee on the Comodo forums However this is certainly not the reason I chose this for the number one position The reason I made this my top pick for advanced users or users who are okay with a somewhat talkative antivirus software is because it is the only product which I feel confident saying that it will protect you against nearly 100 of realworld threats This is because it maintains a whitelist of known safe applications Then all unknown applications which include all unrecognized malware will be sandboxed and isolated from the rest of the system Thus this product provides very strong protection against even zeroday malware 

    Comodo Antivirus also uses the cloud to facilitate the detection of the most recent malware as do many other Free Antiviruses reviewed in this article It will also analyze unknown applications for suspicious behavior and alert the user accordingly However as mentioned previously users who do not want a somewhat talkative antivirus should continue to my next pick Also by default Comodo Antivirus has small advertisements which can be disabled as shown here Also please see my notes in the Quick Selection guide for advice on how to avoid unwanted software during installation 

    Panda Cloud Antivirus is an excellent choice for average users who may find Comodo Antivirus too confusing It has a simple interface completely automated features access to cloudbased protection and has been shown to be very good at protecting a computer Panda Cloud Antivirus has a behavioral blocker web protection and access to cloudbased protection all of which will help increase your security The protection offered by this product is very strong However do note that it will autoquarantine files which it believes to be dangerous 

    Avast Free Antivirus has very good protection rates Avast has many different protection shields boottime scanning a behavioral blocker an internet site ratings plugin script malware protection and access to cloudbased protection Its arguable whether their ratings plugin offers comparable levels to Web of Trust but the script malware protection can prevent certain browser exploits a feature not available in any of the other free AVs reviewed 

    However do note that Avast requires a free registration to function after 30 days and the default installation installs the Chrome browser unless you uncheck it Also note that the OpenCandy advertising component is integrated into the Software Updater tool in Avast More information about OpenCandy can be read here Thus if a user selects this option during the install they will end up with OpenCandy on their computer My advice would be that if you want to install Avast you should not use the Software Updater tool 

    AVG AntiVirus Free Edition is also a good choice for average users My analysis of the results as discussed in the methodology section does show that it does a decent job of protecting your computer However it appears that the above Antivirus products tend to do better Also it comes with advertisements but they can be disabled 

    Avira AntiVir Personal Edition is another product which has a very good reputation However the free version was not tested by any of the three testing organizations I referenced in my methodology Therefore I cannot currently recommend it above any of the previously mentioned products 

    However other comparative tests do show that it has very high detection rates for malware Also many users have used it and found that it is very effective Also Avira provides access to cloudbased protection AntiVir is certainly a good choice for a free antivirus but due to the lack of realworld testing at this time I cannot recommend it above the other products in this review Hopefully in the future they will have the free version tested by these organizations as well 

    Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is another free antivirus product which has a very good reputation However the free version was not tested by any of the three testing organizations I referenced in my methodology Therefore I cannot recommend it above any of the previously mentioned products 

    The engine for this product appears to be very similar the commercial product although there are some tweaks However the level of protection provided has not been shown conclusively to be identical with the paid version which is why I did not use the results for the paid version in my analysis Bitdefender Free has both local and cloudbased definitions Thus users always have access to the most uptodate definitions It also has an effective heuristics engine and uses a component called the Active Virus Control to monitor applications in realtime for suspicious behaviors In addition it also has a webshield which seems quite effective at protecting users from both malware infested and phishing sites 

    The user interface for this product is very minimalist Thus it may be attractive for novice users although more advanced users may be frustrated at the lack of customization However it has no offline installer and it also requires registration to continue using it past 30 days Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is a good choice for a free antivirus but due to the lack of realworld testing at this time I cannot recommend it above the other products in this review Hopefully in the future they will have the free version tested by these organizations as well Also note that if you are having trouble getting Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition to install in English please follow the steps in this post 

    EndNote Please note that I also looked into Forticlient  Kingsoft and Microsoft Security Essentials However I found that the protection offered by these products is subpar Thus if you are considering using Forticlient or Kingsoft I would strongly recommend that you instead consider another of the products reviewed in this article

    Regarding Panda could someone clarify what this means  it will autoquarantine files which it believes to be dangerous
When it does that to a file that I do not want quarantined 
 do I get a heads up
 and is it easy to undo the quarantine 
I am leaning heavily towards installing it in my main PC depending on the answer to those questions 

    I had used Avast for years but it was getting a bit wearing
I tried another one a few months back Cant recall the name but it is well known and gives us 1 year free
None of my PCs are newish and are a mixture XP and W7
I find networking somewhat painful mainly with W7 being too nanny
When I installed that what was its name antivirus my networking got much worse
After I uninstalled that whats its name my networking returned to its slight PIA state 

    I am currently running with no antivirus 3 weeks whilst deciding what to go with
I can reasonably get way with this by being careful in emails I always am and using FF with NoScript
All those minimalistic Chrome lovers out there that do not use FF  Noscript are unwise I tempered that a lot 

    Although I do not think only Panda does that restoring automatically quarantined files is as easy as clicking on the main inteface button on the top the whole interface looks like the new Windows start Interface with the squares and then clicking on the Quarantines View Details button There you will see all the quarantined items and you will be able to restore them If the folder the files were does not exist anymore it will move them to a Lost and found folder If it can find the folder restoring them will also tell Panda the files are harmless so it will not redetect them ever as malware  

    I consider Panda one of the two best lightweight Antiviruses and suggest it to people that want an antivirus with options For friends and users that just want an antivirus that will kill anything and they will never care to change settings I suggest Bitdefender It will brutally quarantine anything that it believes it is harmful be it you like it or not 

    Hi am the new editor here This article is pending a major update for the New Year so its not been updated yet Chiron our previous editor left so Ive big shoes to fill in Unlike our previous editor my results wont be considering the accolades that antiviruses have been getting at independent lab tests because the authenticity of these tests cannot be confirmed as they dont show you proof So Ill be doing my own malware tests on a virtual machine to consider the overall effectiveness of antivirus software  

    That being said its finally the users choice to choose what kind of protection that they need because no matter what antiivrus software you use its a safe bet that you will be protected unless you are deliberately calling for trouble  

    I just hope we are not going down the YouTube track of chucking a bunch of URLs at something knowing that in a few minutes they will have disappeared and then ranking product protection qualities based on their detection  

Its also worth mentioning that a stack of malware can recognize when it is being launched in a virtual environment
MC  Site Manager    Trust online is something harder to get than it is in real life for sure I am not paranoid myself when it comes to tests but I never cared enough if one antivirus has 10 and the other 5 labs points There are plenty sources that show more detailed tests which feel more trustworthy since there are details Indeed though knowing what the test tool does is something that would help us not so much understand but see results as even more trustworthy 

    For better or worse some malware do not hide only in virtual environments but also are able to hide in the system and stay inactive waiting for a chance when for whatever reason the antivirus will not be active and sneak up on the user  

    All antivirus tools have some misses and quite some of them have a good killing ability I am not sure if Avira is still one of the best but that one and Bitdefender seem to prefer to hit more false positives so they they will miss less viruses rather than being more lax and miss more viruses  

    With that said though Antiviruses are not anymore the perfect shield Users should definitely use a browser addon to add a first wall of protection be it like me an adblocker or any other addon that can block malware and afar from that use occasionally an antimalware solution 

    Although this is not the Best Free Spyware And Adware Remover list I wonder why in the current one tools like RKill TDSSKiller AdwCleaner and Junkware Removal Tool are not mentioned at least in a products that are worth mentioning list 

    But this is mostly not necessary for home users because basic protection provided by freeware antivirus is well and good for them Add together a couple of other free security products you are rocksolid Others who doesnt offer a paid for service has other sources of revenue  

    I have been repairing computer systems since 1989 and if there is one thing I have observed the antivirus tests run in labs are significantly different than what happens to users computers Basing a choice of antivirus upon the results of lab tests shows the media wants to avoid assuming any liability  they blame it on someone else What good is advice where no liability was assumed There are some informed comments here and I appreciate those who offer such responses It is obvious because they are not concerned about themselves they express concerns for all of us KUDOS to them 

    Ive been using Bitdefender Free for about 6 months now and while Im an advanced cautious user Ive had no issues with it It took a while to get used to just leaving it alone as in the past Id go in and tweak all the settings of my commercial antivirus
As the author wrote theres no conclusive evidence that the Bitdefender Free engine is the same as the paid but its pretty likely One area that the free is much better than the paid is in usage of system resources This is likely due to all the supplemental features the paid versions have At idle the Free version uses about 25 MB of memory as opposed to close to 250 MB for the paid Bitdefender AV Plus 2015 Consequently the paid Bitdefender uses as much memory as McAfee But I digress
My point is the free Bitdefender is a great product for either A a total set it and forget it user like an elderly relative or B a power user who has trust in the product and whod be able to tell if something were not right on their system 

    Heres the simple layered security setup I use on my Dell every day laptop
1 Bitdefender Free AV  set  forget
2 Windows Firewall  set  f9rget
3 Mcafee Web Advisor aka Site Advisor  for supplemental URL blocking and search engine result ratings Mcafee has the best product in this category IMO by far  far better than Bitdefender Traffic Light

    Win FW  Go to Advanced Settings  Top left side click Outbound Rules  Top right side click New Rule  Check that Program is selected  Click next  Check that This program path is selected  paste CProgram FilesAVAST SoftwareAvastAvastUIexe without quotes  Click next  Check Block the connection is selected  Click next  Check all the 3 options are selected  Click next  Paste AvastUI without quotes in the option Name  Click finish 

    UPDATE 
It seems blocking of AvastUIexe as mentioned above takes care of all the Avast craps ie no adspopups no upgrade button on the main GUI no ads on the main GUI no ChromeToolbar offers options during installupgrade etc 

    I uninstalled Avast Free But didnt remove the block rule for AvastUIexe from Win FW
I had a previous installer so installed Avast Free No ChromeToolbar offers options during install I then upgraded to the latest version  no ChromeToolbar offers options during upgrade 

    of course the internet is now abuzz with the announcement from avg that it now collects and sells your info so another product that i am done with added to these
Samsung spyware on tvs plus pups on phones
Lg spyware
Lenovo spyware and not safe chinese computers
Comodo adware
SOHO Routers
Seagate harddrivescome with rootkits 

    I do wish when posters tout something on here  as in this recent post about Moon Secure AV  theyd do more than tout but instead amplify their contribution in this instance with some reference to calibre of performance and provenance of producer Last I heard Moon Secure was an Indian enterprise which used ClamAV and then ceased business Thats about as staggeringly unimpressive as it gets  so why is this particular AV being promoted in this comments thread Looks like spam to me 

    Not sure about listing MSE Microsoft Security Essentials as unsuitable or subpar
It is true that they rank low on the test scores
But theres an assertion that MSE focuses on the most popular exploits
So we might have a realworld vs academic controversy here
Ie in an academic settings AV tests with contrived threats ie including some rare ones MSE doesnt perform well
But in the realworld with threats that are commonly seen it performs just as well as the others
Ie you have no greater chance of becoming infected with MSE than with any other AV
MSE is also free and fast so I would not demote it 

    My personal opinion is if you take the AV Tests and give them a good shake ie replace the threats tested with an different but equivalent set then everybodys going to score differently
So my opinion pick a fast unobtrusive one Thats MSE or BitDefender today but every year brings a new mix
Actually before coming here today i would have put Panda on that list but people here report popups
And supplement with Malware Bytes antimalware and Super Anti Spyware once a week
And use Sandboxie or VMware player or VirtualBox for risky stuff 

    Then uninstall it and use something else It is a free program I see nothing wrong with providers of free stuff trying to get you to upgrade to something that gives them some compensation for teir work If they do it in a way that is inttrusive to you then just move on Maybe buy a pay program  no ads well usually 

    I am puzzled by your comment about bloatwareopencandy with Avast I have installed it on three laptops and theres no trace of Opencandy on any of them I have found it very easy to avoid installing Chrome if I dont want it
I find an increasing number of nag screens in Avast and it does try to get you to upgrade  always at an alleged discount does anyone ever pay the so called full price
But the free version has been very effective in blocking all sorts of invasions so Im relucatant to abandon it for the reasons you give 

    Yeah me three Been using Avast for years on a number of computers and nothing extra has ever been installed by itself The popups are slightly annoying but are occasional and no real biggie The only thing you have to watch out for besides the Chrome install option and even that didnt show when I installed it yesterday via ninitecom is that during upgrades its easy to click install for the paid version 

    The 15 best free and paid antivirus programs for your PC or laptop in the UK in 20152016 Best Antivirus reviews tests and ratings Where to buy antivirus Best Windows antivirus for PC and laptop See also best security software programs of 20152016 

    If youve just downloaded Windows 10 or bought a new Windows 10 PC dont forget that it will need some help to keep it working as well as it does right now And that means installing security software Here we round up the best free antivirus and best paid antivirus for Windows 10 plus older Windows operating systems running on your PC or laptop See also best business antivirus 20152016 UK 

    Antivirus software detects and then prevents disarms or removes malicious programs or malware often referred to as viruses Antivirus doesnt offer a perfect solution to the problem of malware but it is a critical first step to securing your PC or laptop To help prevent viruses infecting your PC you must install antivirus and then regularly update your antivirus software All of the antivirus software reviewed here will update automatically 

    In recent years the technology that powers AV software has changed dramatically An AV package you purchased a few years ago was able to stop known viruses and other known malware but brandnew unknown viruses proved more difficult Newer products do a better job of stopping them 

    For our antivirus tests we team up with AVTestorg a respected independent securitysoftware testing lab based in Germany AVTest rigorously tests AV products from a number of leading security companies The multifaceted testing procedure looks not only at how well an AV product can detect malware using traditional largely signaturebased methods that is employing a database of known malware types but also at how well it can block brandnew unknown malware AVTest also examines how well a security product can clean up after an infection in the event that a piece of malware does get through 

    Our tests focus on paidfor and free AV products Paidfor AV products usually offer better technical support and more comprehensive protection features than free programs but free is free Internet security suites go further still offering firewalls parental controls identity theft protection and more 

    Here we review the best antivirus programs you can buy or download in the UK right now Securing your PC is of course about a lot more than antivirus At the very least you need to run up to date antivirus antispyware and a firewall Youll find that almost all of the best antivirus software we test these days forms part of an internet security suite so all of the above and more is included 

    The trouble is some antivirus is better than others They all offer a blacklist of known threats and a whitelist of software that is known to be legitimate But these days new threats emerge every day and knowing what is friend and what is foe in realtime can be critical And thats where we come in AVTest challenges Windows security software to withstand threats both old and new known and unknown 

    We then combine that with our own experienced and expert tests of interface and system overhead We test antivirus programs for how much if at all they slow down your PC or laptop as well as how easy to use and how intrusive they are Thus you can see from our regularly updated list of the best antivirus for PC or laptop which is the best for you Best antivirus for protection best antivirus for performance and best antivirus for value Click through to read the individual antivirus reviews 

    
ESET NOD32 Antivirus is a sound antivirus product with some useful extras though its a bit surprising antispam isnt included in the product The software is easy to use and doesnt disrupt the normal function of a PC its running on Technically its a strong contender without being in the front rank
 

    
Panda Global Protection 2015 is a good option if you need to protect a range of different devices from Windows PCs to Macs and Android machines Not quite as generous as McAfees asmanyasyoulike offering and a point off the perfect score in AVTests testing the Panda product costs 20 less too and is particularly easy to use
 

    
GData Internet Security 2015 is relatively inexpensive for a fullfeatured security suite Its not the most successful at beating out web threats but it is sufficiently good to be worth installing A decent purchase if not the best
 

    
If you run a couple of home Windows PCs a Mac a tablet and a smartphone or a similar combination McAfee LiveSafe 2015 is an economical way of protecting them all and providing antitheft facilities on the mobile devices While the feature set of the IS component of the package may lack backup and PC tuneup the power of its AV protection cant be denied  

    
Avast Free Antivirus 2015 is one of the best free security products you can install It offers a surprising range of free goodies including application and browser app analysis and separately an excellent Android suite covering AV and antitheft A better than average AVTest rating completes a very impressive picture
 

    
Panda is one of the leading antivirus providers and this free offering includes a couple of interesting extras We were surprised at the time it took for both the initial and followup test scans but its protection levels are sound and its very easy software to set up and forget
 

    
If you want the extra features that Total Security 2016 offers over and above a plain free antivirus product then Qihoo isnt a bad choice And if you do install it you should head straight into the settings and enable the Bitdefender scanner  

    
BitDefender Free Edition will suit a certain kind of user one who just wants to install the software and let it do its job without recourse to setup changes or manually scans Since it has such a high protection score its safe to do this but if you prefer to have more handson control you may find this approach frustrating
 

    
Overall this is one of the best free AV applications youre going to find With perfect scores from AVTest a good range of facilities for a zerocost suite and a welldesigned interface which is easy to use and direct Avira Free Antivirus 2015 is a great choice to protect your PCs
 

    
A threedevice full protection IS suite for under 50 is good value and when that includes cover on all the major platforms it should be flexible enough for most Kaspersky Total Security 2015s technical strength cant be faulted with only Avira Anti Virus Pro matching it in the AVTest group  

    
This is one of the very best AV suites available in terms of outright protection against malware Its also very good at not throwing up false warnings but there are other products offering more auxiliary modules for the money  

    Avast is one of the three main contenders in the free antivirus world AVG and Avira being the other two As with those two there are paidfor products in Avasts range with more features but the free version has several useful features of its own See also Best internet security software 2015 UK 

    Avast makes quite a thing about its free antivirus offering giving a good breakdown of its feature set and companion programs online as well as naturally offering a range of upgrades to commercial products It offers two main functions antivirus protection and potentially unwanted application PUA detection for when bad apps piggyback themselves on legitimate downloads 

    Theres also a network scanner which looks at your network settings and passwords and suggests improvements to increase their strength The free package doesnt include antispam or a firewall and youll need to upgrade for password protection too 

    Free protection can be extended though by adding Avast Browser Safety also a free download which prevents ad networks from tracking your movements online blocks harmful web sites and offers slightly unexpectedly a price comparison when shopping There are free Avast AV apps for Mac Android and iOS too so you could protect all your devices with pretty much the same software 

    The main control screen is very clearly laid out and makes wide use of tiles demarcating all the important information Theres more info than you often get in free AV products too with a good statistics module covering both the work the software has done on the local computer and what it has achieved for its customers globally 

    Avast took over 1 hour 10 minutes to scan our 50GB basket of test files but it did look at 879891 of them giving a scan rate of 204 filess well up with some of the fastest scanners However theres very little difference in scan time on a second pass just a minute less so not much file fingerprinting going on 

    The Protection rating from AVTest was 5560 which seems a little harsh when in the two months of the test it scored a perfect 100 percent on both zero day and widespread malware detection in the first month and dropped just 1 percent still above the industry average on the zero day testing in the second month 

    The Usability category produced a perfect 6060 with only one false detection in the whole set of samples where the industry average was three This gives the product an overall score of 160180 a very respectable result for a free product though not the best in this group 

    Avast Free Antivirus 2015 is one of the best free security products you can install It offers a surprising range of free goodies including application and browser app analysis and separately an excellent Android suite covering AV and antitheft A better than average AVTest rating completes a very impressive picture 

    Comodo Internet Security is a multilayered security application that keeps hackers out and personal information in Built from the ground up with your security in mind Internet Security offers 360 Virus Protection by combining powerful Antivirus protection an enterprise class packet filtering firewall advanced host intrusion prevention and automatic sandboxing of unknown files 

    It is said that for the good you have a lot of pay It is also said that only paid security programs are able to provide adequate quality of protection Can we expect something more from free software Comodo Internet Security Premium The free version of Comodo is a fully professional version of the security system All the ingredients are high My overall rating 810 I would recommend  

They have made it worse there are no graphs no historical data no component status with viruses blocked virus chest or scan count no realtime data with shields activity download info or last MoreI have been trying for over an hour to uninstall avast from my computer and it refuses to let me It is acting like a malware itself It is not my computer as it works uninstalling everything else More    As recently as a year or two ago it was easy to pick a free antivirus package Almost any of a half dozen free virus scanners did an acceptable job and largely stayed out of the way of the OS when configured properly Times change however 

    A combination of increased malware and virus activity along with lax updates and regression on free antivirus suites has narrowed the field down to a handful of worthy packages Older chart toppers like AVG have fallen hard and fast while outsidethePC solutions such as routerbased antivirus scanning some routers offer fullservice antivirus solutions built right into the firmware blocking threats before they ever touch your PC have become new preliminary lines of defense Its a whole new world out there with more threats and vectors of attack but fewer worthwhile defenders 

    When it comes to the charts no free antivirus software comes close to Avira Number one in realworld performance and ahead of the other free packages in almost every independent antivirus research ranking Avira holds a commanding laboratory lead over the other free packages  

    Avira is also impressive when it comes to features A healthy suite of antivirus tools is provided with link scanning malware and rootkit protection present and accounted for although Avira isnt alone in this generosity AVG offers even more at the same gooseegg price tag 

    While plenty quick in Win 8 and 81 Avira struggles to keep up on Windows 7 systems which remain popular especially for gaming Another more serious problem is the lack of behavioral virus blocking Avira may have excellent threat definition files that get updated with the best in the industry but if the virus isnt on file youre pretty much out of luck 

    Avira also has a spotty record with adware phishing and malware Independent testing shows hitandmiss results producing scores that barely beat Microsofts builtin Security Essentials protection AKA the antivirus worlds counterpart to Notepad 

Aviras malware protection has improved somewhat in recent versions but theres a better way to deal with low and midlevel threats to your PC than allinone antivirus packages More on that in a bit    Despite these quibbles and the occasional nag screen Avira narrowly takes the top slot of the three free antivirus programs looked at here assuming the user faces normal to moderate threat levels Only a few competitors come close paid or otherwise to its mix of protection and performance Nevertheless if Avira doesnt appeal or you need better 0day protection than static definitions provide dont pull out your credit card yet there are other free options 

    Lightfooted Avast shadows Avira in protection scores and generally outpaces it with swift performance in the real world giving it the highest performance of the three packages here although subjective experiences in the lab didnt always bear out these results 

    More singleminded than other antivirus software Avast sticks to the basics and that pays off handsomely in independent performance and protection tests It also means Avast is a better system citizen readily partnering with other security software and sharing duties without creating conflicts between similar services 

    Avast also has a problem with false alarms issuing far more than either AVG or Avira which not only gets old fast but also teaches users to ignore warnings which isnt a smart route for security software to take 

    While theres no custom firewall or other exclusive highend features the package does provide link protection browser cleanup and a handy network vulnerability scanner along with a few other basic tools alongside the primary antivirus component For highrisk users the scanning engine supports behaviorbased virus activity detection and can stop unknown exploits before they are coded into definition updates 

Avasts combination of speed and features isnt enough to unseat Avira for general use but Avast tends to perform better in mid to highthreat situations especially when paired with good malware software    Once a top contender AVG has fallen to the bottom of pick list but remain a viable recommendation While AVG has always lagged a little behind in the others in outright protection and performance it more than compensated by providing an excellent overall set of features and the slickest user experience of the bunch There are matters other than software to consider however 

    While others in the antivirus marketplace spent the last few years adding features upping performance and polishing user interfaces the folks at AVG Technologies followed another route Theyve been busy pioneering an array of annoying popups that try to install security browser addons urge you to upgrade to paid versions or resort to other strongarm tactics that annoy as much as malware itself 

    The latest chapter has the company collecting cleansed customer data for possible sale to advertisers a decision they have decided to stick with over protestations from the userbase privacy advocates and security experts 

    Some of the annoying notifications can be turned off till the next update via buried options in the settings menus and AVG features the best free Windows 7 antivirus protection around and behavioral antivirus protection is included a testament to legacy code and better days 

    In a way the supporting players in the antivirus game are better than the allstars who soak up the credit and headlines You may have noticed the Panda package scored well in tests but wasnt included in the above recommendations Theres a reason for that 

    Pandas offering is an internetbased free antivirus service called Panda Cloud that makes an ideal second line defense that doesnt take on primary antivirus duties but can step in at a moments notice when youd like another opinion on a suspicious file 

    Its also a good fit for systems you need to trust temporarily Consider Panda the ankleholster antivirus option just remember not to have two background scanners or active virus blockers working simultaneously or they can interfere with each other 

    Many adware exploits slip by antivirus programs and while these arent usually as malicious as outright viruses they can still slow down a computer annoy and prove difficult or costly to remove Rather than rely on omnibus antivirus packages alone to stop these specialized tools such as Malwarebytes or Spybot are better bets for adware removal and detection 

    Scanning with Malwarebytes after a standard virus scan frequently reveals all sorts of adware infractions and generally removes them painlessly These misdemeanorlevel alerts are frequently overlooked by larger packages which spent most of their time and detection research stopping more serious threats Like Panda this suite should be on standby next your primary antivirus package 

    One of the best ways to keep your system virus free is simply to run Windows Update regularly Microsoft historically applies patches to Windows on the second Tuesday of every month a tradition called Patch Tuesday If youre worried about one of the many Microsoft muckups regarding patches just wait an extra week or so before applying them Problem reports are usually in by then so you can skip any troublesome updates until the software is sorted out 

    Another way to keep your system secure is via hosts file editing The hosts file is used by your computer to map IP addresses to names and can be edited to map the addresses of known trouble or advertising sites back to the internal loopback address of 127001 meaning they wont connect to your system 

    You can find an excellent regularly updated free hosts file block list here and can implement it with a simple text editor giving you regularly updated malicious URL blocking for free sans dodgy security toolbar search addons Its also a pretty painless way to block ads If you find a blocked site you need access to just delete it from the loopback list 

    Last but not least dont forget to keep a tool like CCleaner handy to erase caches histories passwords banking data and other leftover information if security is of special concern A compromised system cant send secrets it doesnt have An occasional system sweep duplicates some of the functionality found in paid options of antivirus software Theres even a secureerase function 

    While each of these antivirus suites sports a specialty theyre all thoroughbreds With most results only a few percentage points apart its more a matter of matching your needs and workflow than winnowing out weaklings 

    For protection and the comfort of the best overall numbers Avira is the perfect pick If speed simplicity and zeroday protection are top concerns Avast is sure to please If its features you want AVG has them all along with a few annoyances that give pause but arent worth dropping it from consideration 

    Dont forget however that the key to system security is not to rely on any single antivirus package by itself but as part of an array of defenses with antispyware routerbased protections and AV cloud services all employed alongside one another to provide multiple independent barriers against security threats While no system is truly impervious this is as close as youre likely to get especially for the price 

    It doesnt take a genius to tell that the threat of viruses and malware has been growing exponentially with time Their shadow looms over the entire internet Threatening to engulf your personal information and use it for maligned intentions or simple disclosure to the public Newer and newer viruses keep popping up everyday thereby making it essential to guard our system from the constant threat posed by them 

    Lavasofts AdAware has been a pretty reliable spyware tool It offers smooth installation nonintrusive notifications along with detailed custom scanning The UI of the latest version has been vastly improved as compared to the previous version Several features have been incorporated such as Sandbox emulation scheduler and a command line scanner That being said there is a lot of scope for development of the rootkit detection and phishing protection provided by the Antivirus 

    FortiClient is an effective and efficient Free Antivirus which boasts of web filtering a firewall network optimization and parental controls It also provides very good phishing detection and even includes a VPN Client With no perseat license fees FortiClient with its onaccess resident protection enables users  guests to work efficiently anywhere without compromising on their security Although the network optimization seems only to be effective for FortiGate Devices and it is also less effective at blocking certain malicious URLs Moreover the functions of the VPN Client and Parental Control system are also limited 

    Based in China Qihoo 360 offers a wide range of comprehensive effective and userfriendly Internet and mobile security products aiming to protect the users computer and mobile devices against malware and malicious websites Supported by cloudbased security technology the 360 sets itself apart from all other Free Antivirus software through the usage of three different AV engines comprising of Qihoos very own checksumbased engine a machine learning QVM engine and a BitDefender local engine These comprise Qihoos own checksumbased engine in the cloud a machine learning QVM engine It provides a sandbox too through which one can check out for the threats posed by unknown programsThe program lacks out in providing a parental control system Firewall or Backup facility 

    One of the best Free Antivirus currently available The Comodo Antivirus includes a full range of detection engines for viruses rootkits spyware and other malware It uses Comodos proprietary Defense technology thereby guarding your system from all unknown files by treating them as a threat It also provides OnAccessResident protection cloudbased protection and an automatic sandboxing function Since the program occasionally asks for User input it may not be suitable for amateur users The Host Intrusion Prevention System and phishing protection still have a long way to go 

    Malwarebytes is one of the most widely acclaims and highly appreciated malware detection solution It is pretty small lightweight and doesnt require signatures as well It also shields Java and perhaps is one of the most effective software against zeroday attacks that have never been seen before 

    The biggest drawback with it is the requirement for proactive antivirus software that can work alongside it It just acts as a complement to your regular antivirus program There is also a major lack of features in the free version as compared to the Premium version But that being said Malwarebytes still is one of the premier and most reliable products when it comes to catching the newest most cuttingedge threats that other antivirus companies may not have caught yet 

    The BitDefender Free Antivirus is one of the most unobtrusive antivirus available on the Internet today It provides for a Realtime Shield Active Virus Control Intrusion Detection Rootkit scanning and HTTP scanning as well The newly introduced feature of Profiles which adapt the software for particular tasks like watching movies playing games or general office work has improved its userfriendliness by a huge margin as compared to the previous versions Moreover it even includes online banking protection a 2 way firewall and a parental control system Although poor technical support combined with the difficulties faced in installing on systems that are already infected by malware may cause problems to the average user 

    The Panda Cloud Antivirus takes Free Antivirus to a whole new level with its cloudbased scanner The software is also lightweight and runs of a local cache when the network is unavailable It offers effective phishing protection and impressive detection rates combined with topnotch rootkit blocking But it falls behind other Free Antivirus software due to its inefficiency at eradicating malware from already infected system 

    Ranked as one of the best amongst Free Antivirus software Avira boasts of exceptional detection and blocking rates Its small footprint makes it ideal even for older PCs Offering seamlessly fast scans it also boasts of antimalware protection antispyware protection browser protection and cloud based scanning as well Although one could find the interface too cluttered and the installation and execution process to be quite slow as compared to other Free Antivirus software 

    Definitely one of the most popular Free Antivirus software AVG needs no reckoning Furthermore the 2015 version has been revamped to provide a better user interface a cloud based scanning system and the ability to block infected links besides the usual detection and eradication of viruses It is also one of the smallest Antiviruses and also provides script malware protection 

    Editors Recommendation I would prefer Avast over other free antivirus hands down The plethora of features that it boasts of sets it apart from all others Effortless installation an all encompassing heuristic search engine and on access protection pack quite a punch Its features such as realtime protection of files email P2P transfers web surfing instant messages and even suspicious behavior are a notch above your average Free Antivirus software It has been praised for its performance and light use of system resources and has also proved itself efficient in catching malware as well Further developments made in the 2015 version to enhance the user interface merit Avast its place on the top of our list

    Antivirus software isnt necessarily the most glamourous of tech but its crucial if you want to keep your computer running quickly and healthily Fortunately theres plenty of free antivirus protection out there to choose from 

    Free antivirus programs have been around for years In the early days AVG was the best free antivirus but theres no shortage of terrific options right now Weve tested the four most popular free antivirus programs to find out which is best 

    While the internet is arguably safer now than it was in the dark days of Windows XP leaving your PC unprotected is still a bad idea This is doubly true for inexperienced computer users who tend to be less adept at spotting common phishing scams dodgy websites and bogus installers 

    We look at the features sets offered by each free antivirus package in the review and the ease with which they can be used and their settings adjusted Most packages can be set up and largely forgotten but we also want to know whether they cover all the fundamentals youd expect in an AV suite and what extras are on offer 

    We do our own performance tests by timing a scan of a known 50GB basket of files and dividing the time by the number of files scanned We then run the test a second time to check how well the software has fingerprinted the files its already scanned so that it doesnt have to rescan them if they havent changed 

For most of the testing however we rely on results from AVTest wwwavtestorg the wellrespected German antivirus test site which regularly evaluates groups of all the major players in the marketplace    The company evaluates the packages under three separate headings Protection Performance and Usability Protection looks at the effectiveness of the software against both established threats and zero day attacks where it has to rely on heuristics and behavioural analysis 

    Performance checks out the hit AV packages can have on the regular running of a PC It goes further than our tests in looking at its effect on other tasks such as visiting websites downloading installing and running software 

    Finally Usability looks at the softwares ability to avoid false warnings or blocks of legitimate software while installing or running it It uses a set of over 525000 samples to evaluate this performance 

    From these three categories each scored out of 60 AVTest gives every package an overall score out of 180 Software that scores over 120 is certified with the AVTest Award showing that it has achieved a good level of overall performance 

    Always be careful to check any software you put on your computer is suitable and compatible with your existing setup No liability can be accepted for any individual problems caused by acting upon the information given 

    For Windows 7 8 81 or 10 just click on Start go to Control Panel and click the Windows Update icon where it will show you if there are any updates for your PC The same goes for users with Windows 8 or 81 Sadly Microsoft is no longer releasing updates for XP 

Mac users and Linux users have slightly less to worry about in terms of viruses as there still arent as many floating about for them Nonetheless Mac users should grab free antivirus software too     Dont use the same login for lots of sites If one falls into the wrong hands your whole online life is up for grabs Try picking one and add a few letters related specifically to each site youre logging into 

Most web crime still happens via email so be on guard when checking yours Dont open any attachments youre not expecting or click any random links you find in the text see the Phishing Scams guide    The way around this is to make sure youve added senders whose emails youd like to receive to your accepted list The same goes for this sites weekly MoneySaving email its combination of freebies money mortgage and debt info means it can easily get caught in spam filters 

    Only give out your email address to people you know Dont post it on public internet forums including MoneySavingExpertcoms or chat rooms Spammers often use software robots or bots to read all forums store any emails and spam them 

    If you download your emails to a computer eg using Microsofts Outlook you can create rules to stop common spam by entering key words eg VIAGRA so those emails are automatically filtered But spammers try to beat it through misspelling words or using numbers in place of letters eg V14GRA so youll have to block out other combinations too 

    Looking for a piece of software Find out which company makes it first and then go to its site to get it there rather than from a third party site found via Google For smaller free or shareware programs try using big sites such as Downloadcom rather than just getting them from anywhere that shows up 

    These are transmitted via websites email attachments directly over the internet or via any other removable media They hide in applications or files and spread from computer to computer generally wreaking havoc wherever they get the chance 

    Trojan horses are hidden within a harmlesslooking file eg a picture of a celebrity or progam ironically theyre often dressed up as antivirus tools They aim to trick the user into installing malicious software like spyware or adware 

Worms take advantage of any open internet connection They try to sneak in and replicate on the computer Once loaded they often start to send spam email from your computer without your knowledge    Its a common misconception that producing computer viruses is the domain of angstridden teenage geeks with little to do showing off to their equally reclusive peers While there may have been some truth in this at the beginning and of course it still happens these days its often about big criminal business 

    Some viruses allow your computer to be controlled via a DDOS attack This is where a website is closed down due to simulated simultaneous use by millions or even billions of users This can be for political reasons a ransom to hurt competitors or just for fun 

    Many people whose computers cause this are unaware its happening MoneySavingExpertcom has been hit by such an attack Ironically some of the people denied access for three days couldve been contributing to the closure via hidden viruses on their systems

    The softwares unobtrusive and provides quick and comprehensive protection from viruses trojans and spyware For casual Windows users it feels and runs like part of the regular operating system rather than an added extra But some experts say its not as good as it used to be 

    Windows Defender runs in the background and tells you when you need to take specific action You can use it anytime to search for malware if your computer isnt working properly but reviews are mixed on how thorough the scans actually are 

    The free antivirus software of choice for many techies Aviras won many tech publications free antivirus roundups by providing both the most thorough and fastest software protection If you have the knowhow itll do everything you want it to but its best for those that know their way around a PC 

    Panda Securitys free Antivirus 2016 software has been highly praised by reviewers and has scored well on tests carried out by antivirus evaluation site AVTest Plus it includes additional features not often found in free antivirus software 

    For example it prevents USB drives running software automatically when inserted into your computer  as well as vaccinates your own USB sticks against infection from other PCs  and a monitoring function to highlight security information about current running applications 

    AVG is unobtrusive doesnt use too many resources and will regularly autoupdate It includes LinkScanner a realtime threat detector which checks links out when youre surfing the web on Firefox Internet Explorer and Chrome only and marks unsafe threats with red flags 

    Simple to use Sophos antivirus for Macs runs in the background while you work scanning files for threats whenever your Mac opens them Its had fab reviews in techie publications but has been known to slow down some systems 

    So why arent we all going firewall mad Well we tend to connect to the web via a router rather than just a modem and routers provide a hardware firewall Make sure yours is switched on and set to a highenough security level Consult the manual or search online for the make and model number if you dont know how to check 

    While youre there check youve changed your router password from its factoryset default Youd be surprised how many connections are hacked and how much havoc gets wreaked because the standard password hasnt been changed Spend a little time to get your settings right here as router firewalls give a higher level of protection than software ones 

    Windows XP Vista 7 and 8 have a firewall builtin which should be enough for most people especially those who already have router firewalls but make sure its switched on and your copy of Windows is uptodate The firewall can be set on low medium and high levels of protection 

    If the Windows firewall is set on high you may need to spend some time tweaking its settings in the Control Panel to stop it becoming a nuisance By default itll stop you downloading files over Skype and itll block a whole load of programs that download from the web 

Agnitums Outpost free edition is a good allrounder and has a good combination of top protection and userfriendliness Its totally free and there are no messages nagging you to buy a copy    Its totally free but youll need to register and activate the licence by email within 30 days of installation While Comodo outperforms many similar offerings it can be intrusive especially if you just want a firewall that does its job quietly 

    Since the early days all webready Macs have come with some sort of firewall as standard Which yours offers depends on what version of OSX youre using To turn it onoff and change the settings go to System Preferences  Security  Privacy  Firewall 

    There are other types of malware you can find on your computer Often legitimate developers will design programs that have useful functions but theyll also provide the owner with useful information about you or try to sell you things 

Its easy to assume these are related to the site you were visiting yet often they arent If youve closed your browser but popup windows still appear on your desktop chances are youve been infectedMalicious spyware programs have become much more advanced in recent years undoubtedly due to their potential for criminal moneymaking so some of yesterdays top spyware removers can no longer cope    If youre being troubled by adware use a popup blocker to alleviate the symptoms while you find a solution Be aware though that not all popups are bad  some sites open new windows in this way If you want to see them hold down CTRL while clicking the link 

    There are a couple of legit spyware programs Googles Desktop can send info on what youve been searching back to Google and Alexas toolbar can do the same In both cases these firms want to monitor your computer to help develop their products with data about searching habits 

The usual way for adspyware programs to get on your computer is by attaching themselves to other things you download So make sure you check the veracity of download sources before getting files    Like most antivirus tools spyware removers work by comparing whats on your machine to a list of known offenders As ever the top antiadspyware programs are commercial but that doesnt necessarily mean you need to buy them Try these first 

    AdAwares great at detecting and removing malware and this new version works even faster than previous ones On the downside most features are locked in the free version If you make it your primary tool you wont be fully protected 

While the free version doesnt provide realtime protection or scheduled updates AntiMalware is still powerful enough to make a big difference As a lightweight program its pretty quick too    Spybots been going for a while and while it has a pretty long list of features its always received mixed feedback Its fairly processorhungry so if your computers already slow itll be an unwelcome addition 

    SecureMacs MacScan software is built to detect isolate and remove spyware apps as well as blacklisted cookies saved on your system Its a 30day free trial youll pay 40 26 to upgrade if you like it Reviews are mixed so if it doesnt work for you just delete it once the trials finished 

    Not really an antispyware tool but AVGs LinkScanner is worth a look for Mac users It uses realtime threat detection which checks links out when youre browsing the web Firefox and Internet Explorer only and marks unsafe ones with red flags so you know to avoid them 

    Weve all had moments of horror even in this very office where due to hardware failure power cuts or just plain ol silly mistakes precious documents disappear As more and more of our lives are committed to the digital domain backing up data is becoming increasingly important Since there are ways to do it free youll only have yourself to blame if you dont 

    If youd rather keep more tangible copies of your files the options are either storing them on CDs and DVDs youll need a CDDVD writer or on an external USB hard drive for biggermore files As technology marches on the latter are getting increasingly cheap 1TB 1000GB for as low as 40 if you buy online 

    If youve already lost valuable files there may still be some hope in the form of recovery programs Freeware programs Restoration Recuva Puran File Recovery and PC Inspector work to recover lost files but as you may expect its a lottery as to whether they actually succeed

     They say you dont get something for nothing but when it comes to protecting your PC against online threats thats not the case There are plenty of free antivirus tools around that can automatically block malicious code and scan the files on your PC to ensure youre not unknowingly harbouring something nasty In this article we bring you the best free antivirus packages of 2015 to keep your PC safe 

    For those running Windows 7 or Windows Vista the default option is often Microsoft Security Essentials  although you will need to have downloaded it via Windows Update or from Microsofts website If youre on Windows 8 or newer then Windows Defender comes preinstalled and ready to intercept viruses and spyware  

    As antivirus programs go Security Essentials is as straightforward as it gets most of the time you wont even know its there and it has very little impact on the responsiveness of your system In our independent testing throughout 2014 it consistently allowed more malware than other free packages to slip through the cracks but its turned it around dramatically in 2015 now offering performance that is better than some paid alternatives 

    However if youre on Windows 8 or newer then sadly Security Essentials isnt an option  and going by the respected security experts over at AVTest wed recommend installing thirdparty antivirus software Windows Defender puts in a reasonable performance but its still some way behind the likes Avast Free Antivirus 

    Possibly the best known alternative is AVG AntiVirus Free which has been providing free virus protection since the 1990s The modern AVG client actively detects and blocks viruses and also integrates with your browser to warn you away from known dangerous websites 

    Recently weve seen AVGs overall protection results improve markedly from a lowly 76 in the period of JulySetember 2014 to a respectable 94 in our most recent tests see table at the bottom of the page for a full breakdown 

    Our favourite free antivirus tool however remains Avast Free Antivirus  as it was last year In our tests this package gained not only an impressively high protection rating but it did so in the safest possible manner by preventing them from gaining any kind of foothold on our test system This enabled it to maintain an edge over AVG which protected against the same number of threats but allowed more through before neutralising them than Avast 

    Avast is also light on resources and shouldnt noticeably slow your PC down and although like AVG the frontend includes advertisements for paidfor products theyre less plaintive For all these reasons Avast Free Antivirus is our recommended free antivirus package 

    Our most recent tests have seen Avast lose its lead over the rivals here but Avast remains a likeable easytouse package that delivers effective virus protection It is a touch behind Microsoft Security Essentials for overall performance but if youre on Windows 8 or newer its well worth installing 

    Security Essentials has come on in leaps and bounds  it performed better than third party security software from Avast and AVG in our most recent tests If the other features supplied by Avast or AVG appeal to you then by all means switch but theres no need to install anything else to boost your protection levels 

    Additional testing by Dennis technology Labs carried out during January and March 2015 expanded the tests to include Panda Free Antivirus The results indicate its an improvement over Microsoft Security Essentials but that it cant match AVG or Avast for performance 

    Pandas malware protection score isnt bad at 90 nor is its false positives rating which is 94 However its closest rival AVG has been steadily improving of late and performs significantly better particularly when it comes to false positives For the ultimate in protection meanwhile you might want to consider Avast or 360 Safe see below instead 

    Each packages core antimalware features are tested at the stateoftheart facilities of Dennis Technology Labs Rather than artificially infecting the target systems they are set up in an environment that mimics how our PCs become infected in the wild to get an accurate picture of how each security package fends off malware in realworld situations 

    We look at whether the package provides protection and also how it handle each threat The resulting data informs a protection rating of up to 100 Meanwhile we also install legitimate software to see what the security packages block and where they prompt for use r intervention factoring in the obscurity or otherwise of the application We award a second score for false positives where 100 represents a perfect record 

    After formal testing we run through each package to check its other features and get a feel for its usability and its burden on system resources We measure the latter by monitoring RAM and CPU consumption over the course of basic scan also timing how long these scans take to complete All this information is factored into the final Overall star rating youll see at the top of each review 

    screw the dumbass windows defender it sucks ass i have avast antivirus scanner its better its been around longer than windows defender that dumbass thing lets a shitload of viruses get into ur computer enjoy the piece of shit windows defender and McAfee which i might add is a young company and doesnt have much experience as avast does theyve been around since the 80s ur an idiot for removing third party apps that are virus scanners enjoy ur virus infected computer for keeping the dumbass windows defender only 

    If youre clever then youll know that if you knew what you were doing on the Internet then you wouldnt be using such top of the range products in fact if you know 100 then you dont even need an Antivirus program to protect youAnd by the way Microsoft shares their knowledge with third parties such as Avast to improve third party discoveries and third parties take all the credit for it 

    dude ur blind i had a trojin virus and the dumbass windows defender couldnt delete it also avast and macafee did and so did avast they detect viruses much better than shitty windows defender u sir are an idiot 

    Thats the worst virus you can get and sometimes when a virus gets on your system theres nothing you can do about it my friends gf got a virus and it created several Itunes icons before it crashed and she was unable to boot back into Windows and that was Avast protection my mate had Avg still got infected 

    For fixing clients pcs though I use MSE and MalwarebytesFor me when I went through the amount of junk on my mates 81 updated Defender found several browser hijackers and it fixed them Malwarebytes found some Malware 

     Immediately when I setupa pc make sure its setup properly the main problem that adults have with their kids is games which is all they want the problem in Windows is the default Admin account and having 100 unrestricted access to play a game you dont need Admin you dont need that for anything unless youre changing something100 pc problems affecting pcs are done using Admin 

    dude ur really stupid just use the virus scanners i mentioned windows defender cant protect u from bad websites or stuff like that i cant stand my stupid dumbass computer saying activate windows defender it sucks even when i uninstall avast it says windows defender is insufficient so yea it cant delete all viruses and it cant protect u form everything 

     you obviously have a problem with your system whether it be virus or currupted file or changed settings your current setup cant be that good because whenever i did a clean install of Windows for the first time for a client i never got given an insufficient error nor did i get the annoying activate Defender error from your vision of it it doesnt make any sense 

     third party firewalls work similar to the built in firewall they have more features but do the same job all they do is warn you if something attempts to change somethingWindows does that if something isnt on your allowed list it will challenge itsome might say hang on are you sure you want to do this youre not going to say no if you want to do something once you say yes to any Firewall it cant do anything it assumes youre comfortable with the changes 

    on my pc Win 7 all the latest service packs and updates installed Microsoft security essentials installed with Malwarebytes antimalware free i do everyday use in a standard user accountand enter a password when i need to change or install somethingI do update Microsoft Security essentials and run a quick scans often and have run a full scan once a week if i do get infected it has been because i downloaded something and its been flagged as suspicious but isnt actually an infection just a false alarm all of the time i use it the machine is clean 

    i run disc cleanup and disc defrag regularly restart my pc regularly i dont download from unknown sources i will always go to the official link if it works i dont click on random ads taking me to other websites i dont click on suspicious emailsI dont give remote access to the PC to anyoneThe broser i use is Google Chrome Microsoft Security essentials has been more than enough for me 

    well mybe it is enough if you are visiting one or two usual sites but if you are visiting or downloading from many different sites youll need more cause if you visit av test org youll notice microsoft security is the worst 

    im aware that over the past 2 years i think some of the Antivirus reviews have been negative about it but i also know that Microsoft have been always been slammed for poor security patching the amount of security holes and a back door 

    Antivirus apps are truly one of the most controversial genres in all of Android With all the stock protection getting malware is all but impossible so many pundits will say that you dont even need one of these Even though that is true there are people who feel safer with third party protection and dont mind paying for it Really its a toss up If theres a great antivirus Android app that weve missed please let us know in the comments 

    Editors Note Thanks to a change in how Google handles SMS permissions starting in Android 44 there isnt a single antivirus or SMS blocking application that can block SMSMMS on Android 44 KitKat Thats actually a problem caused by Google and their implementation of Hangouts However many of these antivirus applications list SMS blocking as a paid feature knowing full well that it doesnt work on KitKat and took absolutely no steps in warning their potential customers that this is the case Thus all antivirus apps that list call blocking as a paid feature and dont mention that it doesnt work on KitKat took a hit to their ratings Those who list it as a free feature did not because its not a feature people are paying their hard earned money to use It should also be noted that all antivirus apps that dont list their subscription rates in their app description where they belong took a hit to their rating while antivirus apps that provided their price details in their app descriptions got an increase to their rating Transparency matters 

my buddys sister makes 87 every hour on the internet
 She has been unemployed for 6 months but last month her payment was 19402
just working on the internet for a few hours go right here CashfigCOM    Your Alt keys by default only give you characters found in your default MSDDS character set from character 0 to character 255 If you type a larger number then this method wraps that is Alt256 gives the same value as Alt0 Alt257 gives the same value as Alt1 Alt258 gives the same value as Alt2 and so forth until the values wrap again and again and again until you get to Alt3232 which indeed gives you   

    If you type Alt3232 in Microsoft Word or in Wordpad you will get  because in those applications only if you type a value over 255 you will get the Unicode character that corresponds to the decimal value that you typed  

    On a web page and in most forums you can just enter an HTML entity For  the hexadecimal HTML entity is   x c a 0  without quotation marks or spaces The corresponding decimal HTML entity is   3 2 3 2  without quotation marks or spaces Place either entity on a web page or forum and it will convert to the character when viewed provided the viewer has that character in a font and provided the browser properly supports automatic font replacement Otherwise it will appear with an unknown character glyph  

    but the problem is that their 1 year license is only arround 5 without support and 10 for 1 year prety normal they do offer a lifetime license if you want to support them this is in no way mandatory most good package are rated at 75 doesnt see this as a serious review 

    If you download apps from Playstore only  there is no single chance you can get any kind of malware And even if you side load them from your PC  most PC antiviruseswell not counting Drweb as antivirus here scan them for all known malware for android too 

    And since Linux system doesnt allow to get any common viruses from simple browsing downloading strange content is your choice  Any antivirus app will just sit there slowing your system and eating battery
I suggest installing one like once in a month or 2 Run trial scan system and delete it  profit 

    Absolutely not true You really should check your facts The Play Store isnt monitored like iTunes and while malicious apps may be rare they arent unheard of Just try searching for BBM Android malware on Google 

    If you were following Google You d know that since October 2012 Google play has built in malware scan for all app uploaded by developers This scanner got 2 big updates and is really up to date now Also there is loads of free anti thief solutions that are well known and didnt load youre system with antivirusPrey is one of the most trusted for me Also there is one from Google And one for custom roms from cyanogen team  

    If you read carefully article in the linked site  you install app from Google Play that has no malware and than app itself asks you if you want to download an app separatly and downloads it from private server as separate apk file not from Google play Any app can link you to website  its up to you if you agree to sideload app from there 

    Really This article proves otherwise Zoner is one of the more popular antivirus apps on the market with users which would reflect in their comments and yet it only scored 68 in the AV test now to me a 68 is failing This was mentioned earlier ironically in the comments before yours Im guessing you didnt read the comment section but just scanned a few and decided to comment on one 

    Also most comments left will be from users without much user experience You are going to trust a bunch of comments from new users kids teens soccer moms etc when most of you constantly are critical of the writers who work in the industry Please explain how that makes sense We have all looked at the reviews and comments on particular apps that have excellent reviews and comments from 100000 or more users and have thought these people dont know what the F theyre talking about This app sucks Or something to that effect  

    Oh by the way a lot if the reviews and comments on apps are paid for There are users who download the app rate the app write a comment remove the app and get paid Its not much at all but if you do enough of them it adds up 

    Playstore is monitered U got your facts wrong Plus with malwarebytes it also scans every store download and not even once has it detected any virus Theres more junk on this website than and playstore app  

    YEs Lookout was one out t of the first anit virus apps to and was the only one in the playstore
I never really liked LookOut because no mater what it always interfered with something huge battery hog couldnt receive calls people could barley hear me when I talked to them over the phone never got text messages nor was I able to send 

    took me awhile to figure out but once I uninstalled LookOut everything went back to normal
I use ESet mainly because Ive had it on my computers and I think it is one of the best security suites next to AVG and Kapsparskey 

    And I dont know about the mobile version but McAfee is a bitch to get completely out of your system Or at least it used to be They may have fixed that by now It just attached itself too tightly to too many files 

    Ill tell you what Ive used most of these at one time or another on phone laptop or pc and I have Avast and CM on my phone now But until someone finds a way to mess it up CM is the coolest security system Ive ever dealt with 

    Its strange that some authors dont even try to get enough information before posting an article If you want to write about an antivirus you must look at the AVtests AA lists Zoner who got a bad score as you said and Norton which has an impact on performance but they dont talk about Comodo Kingsoft or Kaspersky 

    So what does that test say about device compatibility customer satisfaction resource usage extra features price and availability AVs tests dont measure those things We do All of these are capable and finding the big problems that people are most likely going to run into  

    I understand that and its normal to include these into your review but you cannot include an antivirus that gets a low score at an AVtest eg Zoner gets 68 which is way below the average 952 For an antivirus consumer opinion is less important that its score 

    The point I was trying to make was that Zoner made the list for far more than just its antivirus functions It does a lot more that people could find more useful Also even at 68 it still probably catches and blocks the most common and dangerous malware Android can be infected but lets face it you only get infected if you do something really off the wall like downloading an app from an advertisement on a website that sells black market organs or something crazy like that Most Android users will never find themselves in a situation where theyll even come into contact with that other 32  thank you for the comments 

    I am new to smartphones but I thought antivirus was an important issue When I started my research for the best AV I had no intention of getting other miscellaneous functions There are countless other apps for that Is AV pointless as would be this list and discussing it considering I have no plans of downloading an app from an advertisement on a website that sells black market organs or is it actually important If I need AV I would want one that is free and the best at handling viruses malware and spyware with a popup blocker Something that runs in the background and is easy on the battery and data usage I am I asking for to much What is the bottom line on a simple highly effective AV and how necessary is it in the first  

    Truth be told the miscellaneous functions are what people really want If you follow the rules and dont disable the stock Android security features theres pretty much no risk of anything bad happening to you 

    none you only have to check them out and try to understand why that app is asking that permission
for example if i saw that a calculator ask permission to read sms to the dial to gps etc etc ill be a bit perplexed but for other app maybe that permissions can be necessary 

    And in addition to what Dario753aC said always remember that most developers on Google Play are using those permissions for completely legitimate reasons Dont immediately be alarmed about permissions for accessing contacts making phone calls etc
If its a very mainstream app Like Pandora Radio most of the time you can rest assured that they only want permissions for contacts to provide the typical socialsharing functions youd expect or if an app wants access to the phone dialer its usually just there so you can call a number directly from an app or something stimular
Every permission has a legitimate purpose You just have to be aware that once in a while permissions will be excessive Always email the developer and ask them why before leaving a bad review You can judge by the way they answer if they have something to hide Stick to applications that are well known or come from well known development teams and dont ever be one of the first 1000 people to download an application from a completely unknown developer with no traceable history Wait until there are plenty of reviews to give it your trust Other people will always get curious You dont need to be a lab rat Let them have a crack at it first
If you stick with those very basic tips you should never need an antivirus 

    Im not sure whats more depressing That people think they need an AVP on an Android phone or that sites like androidauthority keep pushing this bull on folks Makes me think they should remove the authority part of their website 

    If this is that bad for you then why do you come here and read these articles Why take the time to write defamating remarks I just dont get it For me I agree that AVP is a waste of resources for me but if other ppl want it then thats their business I didnt pay for their phone and I dont have a right to tell them what they should or should not use The publisher wrote a list of apps because the ppl asked them to Not because the are trying to be THE Authority on others phones 

    ahahah i agree never understood people that has not root dont install external apk dont do anything with their smartphone but facebook and whatsapp and they wanna have an AVP why what do you expect about that do you think youre using windows XP 

    i wanna told what a friend of mine said we were discussing about usefull of AVP and she said that if you dont have an AVP on your android you get a lot of malware and virus only surfing the web with the browser ahahahhaha i was laughting at her too much 

    its the best one to do what i dont think that you need an antivirus on android if you dont install cracked apk so dunno how you can say that one is not good and another one is goodin my opinion on android the antiviruses do a lot of other things not concernig with virus as permission management privacy settings and possibility to find your device in the case youll loose it 

Lookout Security 45 rated is free and provides antivirus scans apps pre installation and routine antitheftloss I have it installed on all of my devices and it has worked flawlessly for years    A new user with a cheap weak GB paygo phone Ive been interested in this topic more for data on the phone and SD than the phone itself After poking around this eve Ive decided BitDefender is the least demanding  most effective Supplemented with Android Lost app for phone recovery the phone is reasonably covered with tiny resource requirements and no cost  

    My only concern so far is that Android Lost might be disabled if the current Gmail account is changed by some moron who wants to steal a 50 phone Im not sure if other phone finder apps have this problem Ive looked at AppLock and similar but they dont seem to add much to my polka dot lock screen that any finder or thief would have to get past Any advice about that would be welcome

    What about Lookout Samsung is going to be including it with all of their future phones very soon giving us another reason to root and remove the bloat Anyway I still think that AV on Android is entirely useless Just be careful what you install and review the permissions Dont root if you dont have to and dont grant root to everything that asks for it You should also disable root for ADB so a savvy thief cant easily hack your phone These AV apps are glorified progress bars and just add lag to your system They also want to sync your data to their own cloud which is not cool considering my contacts photos etc are already backed up through Google Sure the AntiTheft features are good if you dont use Android Device Manager but unless you want to pay to feel more secure I wont be loading any of these apps In fact I scanned a friends phone which had a bad apk that was popping up messages The scanner didnt even find it let alone block the advertising 

    What I want for my rooted phone and Custom Rom is real security so if I lose my phone someone cant steal my ROM image backups or clone my entire phone CyanogenMod 101 is offering SMS encryption between Cyanogen peers Other than encrypting my entire phone another performance hit are there any other ideas out there 

    Im new to smartphones so to the benefit of those that are likewise or that may have questions regarding AV on android I offer this link I found while researching the issue It tackles questions like is the play store malware free what is the main threat to android phones and pros and cons of security apps

anyway root is a part of system you cannot wrote because you can damage the firmware just think about dialer modem gps config boot image if you wrongly cancel a part of that you can damage your firmware and a part of that will not work
so producers dont allow you to wrote that part of system but if you get root access in your phone you can have access to that part of firmware and modify that so there are some apps that requiers access root because they have to access that part of firmware for different reasons 

    in you pc especially in windows you can think about the different type of users there are normal users and administrator in fact when you use a normal user you cant do something and you have to enter with the administrator user 

    but in PCs you already has root acces you only have to log in as administrator in phone it is blocked by producers in order you cant damage the system so in phone you are like the normal user and you have not possibilty to be the administrator user if you dont unlock root access with some zips 

    so we were talking about virus its really improtant that if you got root access on android you dont give root access permission to all the apps you install because when you give them root access they can compromise your system thats why i said that if you dont install cracked app and you dont give root access to all your apps you really dont need to have an AVP 

    I spoke to TMobile tech support re wifi calls While on the phone a pop up said my memory was low but it isnt Tech guy said I could have a virus I said that I have Lookout Tech guy said Lookout could be the problem Um What Im NOT savy re these things so what do I know Now Im just wondering if I should reset my device to factory default  exclude the Lookout install or what  

    Antivirus programs are also memory hog Just yesterday my relative was fixing a computer for someone who had Norton The computer had a 235 GB hard drive and Norton created a 166 GB backup WTF That means that everything else on the hard drive only took up 69 GB and the backup took more than all the other files and the OS on the hard drive I reccomend downloading a file manager and clearing out your internal storage and then do a factory reset to get rid of the antivurs program alltogether They are tricky to get rid of You should find a folder called Lookout or something and delete it 

    I have a galaxy note 2 I dont know how many apps you put on that thing but I dont think spyware is going to make a pop up like thatand after dealing with Time Warner techs I dont know how many times let me tell you the guy doesnt know what hes talking about He actually tried to tell me that the speed test app didnt workand its impossible for their lines to get congested no matter how many people are on it LOL SHOOT ME NOW 

Sorry for the misuderstanding The anouncement says the app will be free this year However the app is available for a while 
Cheers mate    Im using BitDefender because its so light it has a negligible performance impact with a good reputation It does appear these services are unnecessary for the time being but its cheap insurance Dont know why the writer says it only system scans in fact it scans every app install and update and briefly shows a flag that the app is clean 

    If you download apps from those kind of websites you do need an Antivirus If you just install apps from Play Store you dont necessarily need one but check the permissions especially SMS contacts and location access 

    Companies cant give away their product for free and remain in business Period They are making a profit how Perhaps tracking you and selling your data Wake up mindless Droids pull your head out and look around I also noticed a lack of any testing whatsoever Reviews based on the amount of downloads Really 

    NQ Mobile Security and Antivirus is very secure and protective Secures the web as well as phone and its applications Awesome update Great interface Wish they introduce option of daily scanning Wow extra complete mobile security app ever in a very friendly and affordable price I love this app Excellence jobkeep it up buddy 

    I like my lookout app I pay all my bills by encrypted phone call and only my credit card number may be in devices but it is a protected credit card so I wouldnt be held accountable and theres no banking account information or anything embarrassing in my devices By the way I think anyone convicted of identity theft should serve a minimum of 25 years in jailif youre an illegal alien and commit that crime serve it in the jail of your country 

It is the second article first is  that given me an insight to learn which is the best free antivirus software however I wanna know which is the best  a free version or paid    Android smart phones are on the rise now a study conducted  an american university of data and electronic gadgets has proven the more and more people are using the cellphone for to log on to social networking site and to check their emails with this rise ti has become a target for hackers and malicious persons to make virus spy wares and other malwares dont be a victim and leave your private data vulnerable to the blood hound crooks get secure NOW with a trusted antivirus for your phone and tablet today  

    a word of warning on Lookout its a good app and served me well since my first android device buthad a major issue with it recently after purchasing a Gear 2 Neo device
Lookout would freak out and would start running my Note 3s CPU at 100 until the phones battery died or the phone was restarted you could not stop it no matter what you did Uninstalled and havent had issues since seems others had similar issues with Lookout  

    ESET employee speaking here let me correct one small fact  virus definition updates are available for everybody  the difference is that in premium version they are downloaded automatically while with a free version you need to tap a button to download the newest updates 

    Iv personally tried every single one of these apps on different android htc mid range devices and only eset was the best one for theft recovery use of anti virus that dont make the handset crash or start laaging on the installed apps 

    Start working at home with Google Its byfar the best job Ive had Last Wednesday I got a brand new BMW since getting a check for 6474 this  4 weeks past I began this 8months ago and immediately was bringing home at least 77 per hour I work through this link go to tech tab for work detail 

I got Cerberus for AntiTheft it works perfectly fine lookout came installed never used it
Avast works really well too interested in trying CM Security as it was mentioned to be lighter on resourcesThankx for the articletons of choice which is wht I love Round this time last year discovered I had a Heuristics Shuriken Thats is why I will never go near anything that is remotely close to McAfeeThere are few more simple tips and techniques that are very effective You should take these preventive measures in order to protect your devices security I would like to share here     If All you need a lightweight  efficient antivirus scanner you may consider this Antivirus Security Virus scan This has High Ranking Antivirus Security in TOP FREE TOOLS Currently 40

Features  

    The package size of this Antivirus is below 15 MB total space its consume is approximately 5  6 MB in comparision to 1530 MB of many popular antivirus for android on googleplay such as Avast Antivirus AVG antivirus CM Antivirus 

    I have mentioned on my blog post that CM Security is the life time winner I personally use Cm Security for a year and I very much impressed I guarantee you never back down once you use CM Security You can check out why I like CM Security more to other security apps 

    Few days back I shared an article having few fine antivirus apps for Android Devices 
Just few minutes back I was going through an article on Lifehacker where Antivirus programs were one of the programs which are not good for Android device Though I feel that antivirus programs also protect from the virus which is mostly carried in our SD card
Though I shared only 6 Antivirus programs in my list which are also listed in your list I would like to update my article soon with the remaining ones Glad that I landed here 

    I used to have CM It would do a complete scan in less than 1015 seconds Sorry but that just doesnt seem right I now use Avast and it takes more than 3 12 minutes for a complete scan I have no faith in CM None whatsoever  

    If this was Windows and theres plenty of driveby malware that can occur if youre running Internet Explorer and such then obviously you need a minimum level of virus protection on your PC But this is Android and driveby malware doesnt infect the phone like that right 

    So if you just stick to the Google Play store and mostly just install the TripleA apps like Whatsapp Hangouts Instagram etc etc then what is the danger here Why would need all this virus protection apps then 

I dont mind my latest find a lite antivirus that is under 2mb in app size It even caught a new virus in a game as soon as installed from google play store I am impressed     Even this antivirus is too cool   It even monitors every app install to ensure security  that new app is virus free This light antivirus is also about 2 MB in size light  efficient antivirus security for 2015 

    I like to have a security app that protects and cleans my phone in one app Unlike Clean Master and CM Security where you need both to clean and protect your phone I found PSafe total and 360 Security to be the best that fits my needs 

    At one time I tried CM and it would do a scan in a few seconds I now have Avast and it takes around eight minutes to do a scan No way CM can do a complete scan in a few seconds Theres enough Chinese crap sent here Im not taking Chinese security on my phone and tablet 

    The applications lightgray interface is straightforward and selfexplanatory featuring a navigational pane on the left that consists of five primary buttons and a realtime graph that aggregates shield activity and allows users to quickly check the overall stats of their computer Although the software automatically updates and enables subtle popup notifications by default users can easily turn off either feature if they prefer greater manual control or wish to subdue the alerts entirely The software is also relatively lightweight hovering around a paltry 750MB in size and tailored for Macspecific malware A builtin firewall or parental controls would be nice its tough to argue with more than 25 years of service and a sprawling user base 

    ClamXav is not your typical antivirus software The opensource software is barebones and rudimentary in nature designed as a graphical user interface for the open source ClamAV antivirus engine while still boasting the same functionality youd likely find in most paid antivirus apps The app can scan individual files or entire folders ondemand on access or on schedule subsequently detecting and quarantining both Mac OS X and Windowsbased malware swiftly and efficiently 

    It doesnt handle email scans quite as fluidly and methodically as Avast  the detection system is often overly aggressive when it comes to pinpointing potential threats  but it is capable of removing malware from your mailbox and allows users to save their favorite scan locations for quicker access Also although ClamXav is natively powered by the ClamAV engine those familiar with code can incorporate their own engine build instead adding substantial flexibility catered more toward opensource aficionados than the everyday user 

    The program is also relatively light on resources clad in a gray minimalist interface that makes starting and halting scans a breeze and comes equipped with a tool known as Sentry that conveniently monitors changes to specific files and folders opposed to your entire system The softwares biggest drawback aside from occasionally sluggish scan speeds is easily how infrequent virus definitions update Still the sheer level of flexibility ClamXav offers gives the software a slight upper hand above its closedsource competition 

    If offering an entire history of Mac malware dating back to 82 isnt evident of a developer on top of its game I dont know what is Straddling the line somewhere between necessity and excess Sophos offers all the basic utilities youve come to expect from quality antivirus software The utility offers custom ondemand and scheduled scans for specified files folders and drives along with additional tools for deleting and quarantining any software Sophos deems as a potential threat 

    The software even incorporates a Live Antivirus feature that will quarantine unknown files that are merely exhibiting suspicious behavior in line with that of malicious threats  a tool that could potentially be seen as overkill but is a reassuring precaution all the same Although the program has a tendency to scan slower than most its fairly lightweight and nonobtrusively performs vital background tasks while barely leeching or exhausting your systems resources 

    Despite the notable feature set Sophos manages to fit each facet of the software within a compact cocoabased interface that looks and feels like a native Mac app Initiating a fullsystem scan can be done directly from the top of main interface while additional options for more specific scans are discretely housed within a dropdown menu located at the bottom of the window Additionally its malware definitions are constantly being updated ensuring the program is never without the latest knowledge of potential threats Its one of the most handsoff antivirus programs on the market and as such sits among the best 

    Bitdefender Virus Scanner does not live up to its premium brethren Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac in terms of scope or functionality However the lightweight app remains a capable piece of software for those seeking basic protection against Macbased malware and its Windows counterpart Its built upon the companys awardwinning antivirus engine and features a host of scan options allowing you to quickly perform deep scans of your entire system or those targeting specific locations If you grant it access the streamlined program even provides an option for scanning critical locations  such as your Macs launch agents and the entirety of your system library  thus allowing you to bypass lengthier scans when pressed for time Moreover it automatically updates with Bitdefenders hourly malware definitions prior to scanning while providing a quick means for blacklisting specific locations from system scans 

    Some things though not all are worth the wait Although German security firm Avira took its sweet time regarding a Mac incarnation of its beloved antivirus for Windows the company built a Mac version that remains completely free for all users  whether being utilized by private consumers professionals or even multinational corporations The software strikes a nice balance between ease of use and quick access to advance utilities ultimately rendering basic system scans just as simple to execute as those that are scheduled and filespecific The software is equipped with standard spyware and adware protection along with the ability to intercept harmful websites and block tracking and comes bundled with 5GB of online storage in addition to oneclick deletion of malicious files 

Very Light and fast download scans are very fast Excellent malicious web filter blocking Many features Excellent detection rates You CAN set to automatic scheduled scan I do not know softonic MoreGreat idea keeping all the scanning on the cloud to save processing power Terrible execution I kept experiencing problems on my PC one of which being my connection dropping continuously so I More    A professionalgrade interface Free programs and utilities often look kludgy and dated and have confusing or cryptic navigation Avira however feels like software that you would ordinarily pay for It almost looks like something built into the operating system and you can navigate using either the lefthand pane or the dropdown menus along the top 

    Lots of optional configuration Avira works just fine out of the box capable of running system scans without slowing down other tasks like loading webpages or editing a document But if you want you can change settings like the number of days before Avira warns you that its definition file basically a book of virus mug shots is out of date You can also specify what types of compressed files you want to be scanned or ignored ignore specific files or processes target specific file extensions and search for root kits before scanning Its unusual to find this many options in a free antivirus app  and you must have administrator privileges to change anything so secondary accounts cant log in and tamper with it 

    Free antivirus software can do a surprisingly decent job  as long as you dont want any frills Paid antivirus software still outperforms the free stuff catching more malware and having fewer false positives detecting and even removing threats that arent there  an error that can hurt your computer Youll also need to do without some features that can be helpful features and are found in paid software like protecting you on Facebook and Twitter or when youre paying online with your credit card  

    Free software also peppers you with ads which can get pretty annoying as they nag you to upgrade to the companys premium read paid versions Still if youre looking for nocost nofrills antivirus software these programs are getting better and better every year 

    Panda Free Antivirus 2015 Free is an Editors Choice at PCMagcom AVTestorg gave it a perfect score for protecting Windows 81 systems in a test it ran in SeptOct 2014  equal to the best paid product Panda didnt fare as well when it came to system impact or usability and exceeded the industry average when it came to incorrectly identifying legitimate software as malware At AVComparativescom the Panda antivirus engine scores well in tests gauged to measure effectiveness Advanced or Advanced ratings but only the lowest acceptable rating Standard when it comes to its impact on system performance User reviews at Downloadcom are solid and it earns a 45star rating from the editors there 

    Panda Free Antivirus offers many of the same protections as the paid version of Panda That includes realtime antivirus and antispyware scanning and the monitoring of files and processes to spot brand new viruses based on their behavior It can also warn you off of malicious web sites Theres also a tool that lets you create a bootable rescue USB drive that can scan and clean an infected computer Downloadcoms Eddie Cho warns that it pays to pay attention during install as default options can switch your preferred search engine and browser start page  of course that type of annoying behavior is part of lots of free software and even some paid products Beyond that installation is easy PCMagcom reports and the user interface is clean and modern 

    There are lots of other free antivirus programs worth considering Avast Free Antivirus 2015 Free is recommended by one independent reviewer and is a Downloadcom Download Pick Its also adored by users All versions earn an overall score of 45 stars following more than 26500 user ratings at Downloadcom and thats outstanding compared to the feedback that most security software receives at that site the current version scores similarly well following more than 300 ratings At Amazoncom more than 8700 users team up to award Avast a score of 46 stars  

    Lab test results for Avast are kind of all over the place but largely point to a product that performs better than most free antivirus software though a step behind the very best paid products AVTestorgs results reveal that Avast Free Antivirus 2015 performs on a par with other products free and paid when it comes to malware protection and above average when it comes to usability and freedom from false positives However it extracts a higher than industry average hit when it comes to system slowdowns At AVComparativesorg Avast does a good job of correctly identifying malicious files but its falsealarm rate is literally off the charts  the exact opposite of the finding at AVTestorg Otherwise the software earns solid Advanced or Advanced ratings when it comes to malware prevention and minimal impact to system resources  the latter another contradiction to the AVTestorg findings Dennis Technology Labs gives Avast an AA rating its second highest score  

    One place where Avast has an advantage over most free and some paid antivirus software is that it is relatively feature rich The big plus is the ability to analyze your entire network for security holes including your router and any wireless devices Browser Cleanup goes beyond just cleaning out caches and cookies by letting you remove unwanted toolbars and extensions you may have unwittingly let thirdparty software install Software updater looks for new versions and patches for popular software

 This ConsumerSearchcom page has been optimized for print To view this page in its original form please visit      Windows 10 wont hassle you to install an antivirus like Windows 7 did Since Windows 8 Windows now includes a builtin antivirus named Windows Defender But is it really the best for protecting your PC  or even just good enough 

    Windows Defender is essentially the latest version of Microsoft Security Essentials a free antivirus program Microsoft offered for Windows 7 Now its builtin ensuring all Windows 10 PCs have some baseline level of antivirus protection 

Antivirus is already running out of the box Windows Defender automatically scans programs you open downloads new definitions from Windows Update and provides an interface you can use for indepth scans    But how good is this Well truth be told Microsofts antivirus is a bit behind the others when it comes to comparative antivirus software tests Weve sounded the alarm on this before and we were particularly worried because we had previously liked Microsofts antivirus product so much 

    Windows Defender has a lot of advantages Its builtin wont harass you with popups and requests for money and is lighter than some competing antivirus solutions It wont attempt to harvest your browsing data and make money from it as some free antivirus programs have started doing in an attempt to make a profit 

    Overall though Windows Defender doesnt provide bad protection Assuming you keep Windows uptodate  which happens automatically now  and use an uptodate browser avoiding potentially dangerous plugins like Java  you should be okay Windows Defender and with the standard computer security practices you should be following anyway do a fine job 

    Despite the low scores offered to Windows Defender by AVTest  just 056 for protection  Windows Defender caught 95 percent of the widespread and prevalent malware in June 2015 along with 85 percent of the zeroday attacks BitDefender managed 100 percent and 100 percent of the tested samples while Kaspersky managed 100 percent and 99 percent So despite the wide difference in scores Windows Defender still does a solid job In the past Microsoft has alleged that it focuses on malware thats actually prevalent in the real world while the tests arent representative and other antivirus 

    Windows Defender should probably be fine for most PCs along with some common sense and other good security practices However if youre regularly downloading pirated applications and engaging in other highrisk behaviors you may want to skip Windows Defender and get something that does better against the collection of obscure malware samples used to test antivirus software 

    We also recommend an antiexploit program to protect your web browser and plugins which are the most targeted by attackers MalwareBytes AntiExploit is the free program we recommend here It functions similarly to Microsofts own EMET security tool but its more userfriendly and offers more security features This helps block common exploit techniques even if they are zeroday attacks that have never seen before MalwareBytes AntiExploit would have blocked all those nasty Flash zeroday attacks you heard of recently for example It hardens your browser plugins and other targets attackers frequently target defending you against the most common attack techniques rather than attempting to catalog and defend against every known piece of malicious software 

    Windows Defender plus MalwareBytes AntiExploit is a good free lowhassle combination of security programs we recommend to keep the average Windows 10 PC secure Enterprise Windows 10 PCs would often have Windows Defender running along with Microsoft EMET but Windows defender and MalwareBytes AntiExploit is a better combination for the average home PC 

    MalwareBytes itself is a solid antimalware program that functions well as a compliment to any antivirus program including Windows Defender It finds a lot of the potentially unwanted programs PUPs and other junkware that a typical antivirus wont find but MalwareBytes AntiExploit is a separate program 

    If youre looking for a free antivirus solution Windows Defender really is fairly solid But if you want something else be sure to avoid installing whatever toolbar or browser extensions the antivirus wants to install Free antivirus companies have turned to bundling software and harvesting data to pay for those free antivirus solutions 

    Windows Defender will automatically disable itself when you install a thirdparty antivirus and then reenable itself again if you ever uninstall that thirdparty antivirus Its designed to get out of the way 

    Selecting an antivirus that has better protection scores against obscure malware you may never encounter may help make you a bit safer but other security practices are more important Ensuring you stay safe and keep your system secure is more helpful 

    And considering the scariest attacks these days are zerodays that use holes in browser plugins and plugins themselves to compromise your system MalwareBytes AntiExploit will likely offer better real security against the actual most dangerous attacks than a replacement antivirus 

    Something of note with BitDefender Free and Windows 10 I run BitDefender Free on most of my systems and I purchased a Windows 10 Surface Friday While installing my usual suite of programs I found that the notification and default Start button stopped working The culprit was BitDefender Free With no settings to make adjustments I had to drop it in order to get it back in working order Not a huge problem but something I found people were running into and getting frustrated with 

    I used to use Bitdefender but then it started getting bloated demanding and annoying so I stopped using it 2012 version There were constant warnings etc and it drove me up the wall Bitdefender was great until they started adding a lot of unnecessary items to it like a wallet etc I called their customer service and they told me the constant warnings were to protect me If your security software is a constant annoyance why have it 

    I went back to Kaspersky and that is where I plan to stay Kaspersky has been around for a long time and they have a great track record I have it on my Android phone as well I do not download pirated or dangerous applications but many people have been hit by flyby malware just browsing the web Remember the one that claimed to be the FBI and highjacked peoples computers My daughter got hit with that one  

    How sad to see Java labeled as dangerous Ive removed it from my machine but then discovered that some very reputable web sites could not accessed without it so its still on my machine No problems so far anyway BTW Kaspersky lets us download their latest version as long as the subscription is valid My version was having issues with Windows 10 but their latest 2016 edition works perfectly 

    The problem is finding a reliable pure AV product like MSE Unfortunately a lot of the mainstream alternative are loaded up with extra security junkware that in turn cause other issues and complications 

    You didnt mention Eset If you go to Virus Bulletin VB 100 Awards you find that Eset has passed 91 time failed twice and not submitted four times since 1998 Check that against any other antivirus vendor Eset is the most consistent software on the market as far as Virus Bulletin is concerned 

    On my wifes Win10 laptop I am running Avast Free MalWareBytes Antimalware and MalWare Bytes AntiExploit SpywareBlaster and ZoneAlarm Firewall Only two are from the same company and to me that means alot like the AV not having loopholes in the firewall to connect out Right now I am working on a registry hack that will allow me to uninstall Windows Defender and Edge as I refuse to trust any Microsoft browser 

    I downloaded Panda Free precisely because PCMag recommended it Every day it gave me several reminders that I was using the free version and I should get the paid version I understand the need to make money but I dont need that annoyance I uninstalled it and went back to Defender 

    I agree with the recommendation for Malwarebytes AntiExploit for protecting against most browser infections I regularly remove such infections from my clients computers and I install both Malwarebytes AntiExploit and Malwarebytes AntiMalware along with a good antivirus like Kaspersky or Panda for enhanced protection after the cleanup With Panda be sure and uncheck the 3 addon offers at the bottom of the installation splash screen As mentioned above these provide useless adware redirection Driveby or flyby downloading sites seem to catch my clients most often with unwanted software and infections 

    I have win 10 pro with updates blocked so I can apply them at my convenience However once you start updates you get all of the outstanding To me it seems like Defender is almost a Trojan Horse Defender updates are very often and if you want to stay updated then you get all of the other updates also 

    Why doesnt anyone ever mention IOLO System Mechanic Ive been using their Pro version for more years than I can remember It has served me well and kept my PC clean and virus free plus cleaning the system and defragging the hard drive One wonders if the ones you recommend pay How to Geek to do that and IOLO dontRegards Colin 

    Were big fans of hacking the Windows Registry around here and weve got one of the biggest collections of registry hacks youll find Dont believe us Heres a list of the top 50 registry hacks that weve covered 

    What I use is what I use My choices have nothing to do with this site or any other Ive used System Mechanic in the past and it worked well I have tried all kinds of different products over the years but over the long haul I prefer Kaspersky which also protects against malware etc For regular cleaning I use CCleaner and for defragging I use Defraggler by Piriform Ive also used Malwarebytes for many years but it does not get along well these days either Bitdefender or Kaspersky I keep a download on hand in the event that I ever need it Its really a matter of choice and preference I you are happy with System Mechanic then by all means stick with it 

    I used to love Bitdefender but started having problems with it very much like you experienced They took a simple product that worked well and added a bunch of unnecessary stuff that caused problems so I went back to Kaspersky and life is good 

    Probably gonna stick with my triumphant trio of Avast FreeInternet Security later on the main computer bc its the on I care more about Ccleaner and Spybot They work well together have yet to become bloated after many updates although Spybot wants me to upgrade to its full version but is very passive about that and do their respective jobs without much fuss or muss and few issue Dont see why Id want to use something that hackers would specifically target when far better programs are on the market

    You shouldnt have to install all updates just to get updates for Windows DefenderIf the Settings app doesnt let you pick updates to install you should be able to just open Windows Defender goto the update tab and click update to only update Windows Defender 

    However for people who do internet banking and store sensitive personal information on their machines I have never been able to get my head around why they economize a few  on an full antivirus security suite license when the protection of their life savings are at stake 

    Malwarebytes AntiExploit looks like a good product However when you look at how it works    the premium version appears to be the equivalent of Microsofts free EMET which I installed and set to Maximum security  

    Defense in Depth  I put a tick in the box for each of these items from the Australian Defence Signals Directorate the Australian equivalent of the NSA and GCHQ for my home computing environmentDSD Top Mitigation Strategies 2014 

    Im just a home PC user thats on the Internet six hours per day Windows Defender has never ONCE informed me of a detected malware or virus so I have no idea where this article gets their info saying Defender detects 95 If it does maybe it does so without informing the computer user Who knows As for me I dont use Defender I dont antivirus software either I mean really Do any of you need to be informed when your system has been infected by a virus or malware I know I dont Plus most antivirus programs cant completely remove viruses and certain malware anyway plus they tend to slow systems down to some degree What I did for myself years ago was I learned how to properly format my hard drives then reinstall my operating system updates drivers and software This way I never have to worry about viruses or malware I automatically get rid of them completely when formatting my hard drives and starting over And I have a greatrunning PC whenever I want without the need to pay money to someone else to do the work I go through the process every four or five months usually when website pages load slowly no matter what browser Im using at the time When one browser starts to load pages slowly  I download and use another browser  works for me Antivirus software is a waste of time and money except for companies and businesses in my unprofessional opinion 

    The problem with antivirus and malware suites is that they rely on signature listsThey dont all pick up everything This is how you scan your computer with all of themedit by mod link removed no shameless self promotion without prior approval Thank you 

    Someone mentioned above a lot of false positives by Malwarebytes They were faulty registry strings leftover by program uninstalls First of all isnt it a good thing to get rid of garbage like that 1 to Malwarebytes even if that wasnt an intended resultMy personal routine when I choose to really check my systems is to first thoroughly clean out stuff like that do all my updates and then scan for viruses 99 of the time I never see anything in the scan results except stuff that needs to goLike someone else said above one program isnt going to get it all Its best to use an arsenal I right now use Avast Spybot and the Malwarebytes antiexploit and Antimalwarebytes Because of this Windows Defender isnt running on my systembut I may uninstall Avast and give it a shot

    I have never downloaded the Microsoft Security Essentials but I distinctly remember the issue of Windows Defender being deactivated on my Windows 7 systems andon my old Vista desktop In other words I didnt have to wait for Windows 10 for me to have itits been around for some systems at least since Vista I skipped the 8x abomination entirely

    The term antivirus software stems from the early days of computer viruses in which programs were created to remove viruses and prevent them from spreading However over the years different types of malicious software often called malware emerged as threats to personal and work computers worldwide Malware is an umbrella term to describe several different kinds of malicious programs including computer viruses 

    Although antivirus software evolved to combat new malware the term antivirus stuck even though the term antimalware is truer to the softwares capabilities To give you an idea of the different types of malware out there weve identified malware types that are potential threats to computer systems today 

    Worms These malicious programs are designed to replicate themselves quickly with the intent to spread to other computers often through a computer network Although they may not be designed to intentionally impair computer systems worms generally do some sort of damage or harm to the network itself by consuming bandwidth at the very least Most worms are designed only to spread as quickly as possible so they may not try to change the computer systems they pass through However worms have been and are capable of creating backdoor security vulnerabilities deleting files or even sending files via email This is a common method for spam senders to spread junk email quickly as the more computers the worms infect the faster the spam mail spreads 

    Trojan Horses Trojan horses or Trojans for short are different from worms in that they are not designed to replicate themselves Rather Trojans are designed to trick you into downloading and executing them to cause data loss theft and sometimes totalsystem harm Just as in the ancient Greek story of the wooden horse designed to deceive the soldiers of Troy Trojans present themselves as useful interesting or routine programs to trick you into installing them on your computer 

    Spyware This software is designed to gather information about you without your knowledge This information can be sent to another party without your consent and in some rather malicious cases it can even be used to take control over a computer Spyware is capable of collecting any type of data including your internet history and banking information Some forms of spyware can install additional software or change your internet or browser settings which can be a mere annoyance or a problem that can take days to fix 

    Ransomware This incarnation of malware infects your computer with the intention of restricting access to your computer system perhaps preventing you from surfing the internet or accessing the hard drive and then demanding a payment to the malware creators The trouble with this software is that it tries to imitate the look of genuine trusted software to trick you into buying a solution For example some forms of ransomware tell you that your user license for a particular application has expired and you need to repurchase the license Some of the trickiest ransomware creators have acquired millions of dollars from unsuspecting users 

    Rootkits Rootkits are stealthy types of malware that attempt to hide from typical methods of detection and allow continued privileged access to a computer This essentially means that the rootkit attempts to gain administrator access on your computer and then hides itself so you dont know it is on your system This type of malware is generally difficult to detect and remove because it tries to embed itself thoroughly and deeply into your computers system 

    Malware is not limited to these five examples but this gives you a sense of how malicious and vicious malware can be Fortunately antivirus software is designed to combat these threats by preventing the programs from entering your system and quarantining and removing any malware that does get through The best way to protect yourself from malware is to update your computer system when prompted and to purchase thirdparty antivirus software that protects your computer 247 

    You may ask yourself why you need antivirus software when your computer comes with or makes readily available free antivirus software found in Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials Windows Defender has been available since the Windows Vista days as an antispyware program designed to monitor and detect programs that try to gather information about you without your knowledge With the release of Windows 8 Windows Defender was upgraded to offer additional antivirus protection features Windows 10 comes with Windows Defender built in to the operating system itself Microsoft Security Essentials offers antivirus protection against viruses spyware Trojans and rootkits and it is available on Windows XP Vista and 7 but not on Windows 8 

    Although Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials offer builtin support and Microsoft continues to improve upon these systems they dont generate high scores in the tests conducted by AVTest the respected independent antivirus software test lab This is expected to a point as these programs were designed as a baseline of protection for users who dont plan on purchasing commercial antivirus protection However AVTest regularly publishes its test results comparing both Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials to the top thirdparty antivirus programs The thirdparty systems score higher every single time 

    So is antivirus software necessary when Windows already has builtin protections against viruses Although baseline virus protections can give you some sense of security you want the topperforming antivirus programs to make sure you are always protected AVTest tests two separate categories of malware or virus interception the detection of widespread and prevalent viruses and the detection of zeroday or brandnew malware attacks In both categories of tests Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials performed poorer than the industry standard regardless of which Windows operating system was used during the tests This means that thirdparty antivirus programs are more capable of protecting your computer and you against malicious virus attacks Visit our learning center to find out more about how the top antivirus software can help you secure your computer 

    As you search for the best antivirus software youre going to run into free software that claims it is as capable as paid programs If you were to rank antivirus software categories into three different tiers youd find free software in the bottom tier with the least functionality and protection Although free software can be enticing free antivirus protection is not as capable as paid software All free programs can scan for viruses but only some of them scan for malware automatically and offer realtime protection or browser addons to help you avoid bad links Most advanced features are limited to paid antivirus programs 

    One annoyance of free antivirus software is that each program displays ads for the full paid version of the product This doesnt detract from the free versions performance or capability but it can be distracting and annoying Some programs even immediately launch your web browser and link to their companys website if you click on a feature that isnt available in the free version which may be minor but annoying nonetheless 

    Perhaps the biggest frustration with even the best free antivirus programs is the general lack of support offered by the developers Paid programs generally offer extensive technical support allowing you to contact the manufacturer via email phone and live chat Free programs generally leave you fending for yourself with user manuals or a knowledgebase in which you have to comb through information before you find helpful material specific to you 

    Each tier of PC virus protection lends itself to different users in different situations Here are a few of the main components found in antivirus suites that you wont find in entrylevel antivirus software 

    Antivirus Software As stated above antivirus software is the entrylevel version of virus protection for your PC That is not to say this software is ineffective as it can protect your personal computer from even the most vicious viruses In fact all antivirus software includes tools to block or remove spyware worms rootkits and other malware types Rather this particular set of virus protection software has fewer features than the two antivirus suites This software does include the ability to scan incoming email for potential threats automatically clean or quarantine infected files and create bootable rescue disks to name a few of its many features 

    Internet Security Suites Internet security suites generally contain all of the tools found in entrylevel antispyware such as antimalware PC tuneup utilities safe online banking and shopping secure browsing vulnerability scanning and privacy protection However these suites include additional features that add more levels of security and protection to your computer system Most internet security suites include an alternate firewall from the one included with the Windows operating system and many even offer social network protection designed to detect threats through your online social presence Additionally these antivirus suites include parental controls to limit where your children go while on the internet which can protect the computer system and more importantly your children 

    Premium Security Suites Although the additional protections found in internet security suites are highly valuable premium security suites offer even more protection Just as internet security suites contain all of the features found in antivirus software premium suites include all of the features found in internet suites These programs add extra layers of protection in the form of file shredders online backup system tuneup utilities and password managers In other words these suites tend to be the best of the best offering an entire arsenal of defenses and protection against malware 

    With the different tiers of computer antivirus software demystified you can determine the level of security you require and apply that to your particular situation Although they arent the best or most comprehensive programs free antivirus software allows you to scan and remove threats on your computer for the most part However free software lacks the functionality features and overall support that is readily available on paid programs Entrylevel antivirus software provides significant advancements over freeware and its feature set provides enough functionality for many home users Internet security suites provide even more features while premium security suites are the pinnacle of PC protection 

    No matter which antivirus software catches your eye make sure you consider help and support before making your final decision Look for a program that offers 247 access to support through email phone or live chat Regular easy access to support ensures that you can get the help you need whether you have a simple question or your entire computer system crashes and you need immediate help Whether youre looking for protection on your Windows 10 tablet Windows 8 laptop or Windows 7 business computers make sure the software has numerous means of technical support 

    Regardless of what your small business does youve worked hard to build it and keep it moving forward Even if you dont want to purchase antivirus software for your personal computer you should consider antivirus protection for your business computers to ensure that you your employees and your clients are safe from aggressive malware As our computers become more advanced with more meticulous refined technology and software engineering hackers and viruses follow suit and adapt to become more efficient and malicious The last thing you want is to leave a door open for an attack that can affect your entire business in one fell swoop 

    However choosing the right antivirus software for your business may seem like a daunting task and it can be tempting to purchase the most expensive premium programs assuming they meet all of your needs This is not necessarily the case In our lineup of the best small business antivirus software we evaluated the overall performance of each program and compared their features to help you determine which programs can serve your needs As you consider which software is right for your business needs consider the following 

    Licenses  Pricing First if youre running a shop on your own kudos Second a onemanband business doesnt require antivirus software with 20 user licenses to stay up and running On the other hand if you employ a few people who require personal work computers you dont want to purchase licenses for only one or two of the computers Every employee should have their computer protected so that a virus doesnt make its way through an unprotected system and travel from computer to computer within your business 

    Make sure you protect every computer within your business from virus attacks no matter if you have one computer or 20 Also as a small business you want to make sure the software you purchase is affordable Fortunately most antivirus programs are priced similarly to each other so you dont have to worry too much about searching for the best bargain 

    Malware Protection If youre purchasing antivirus software for your small business you want to make sure it performs its most basic function  protecting you from malware  well AVTest put all the software in our antivirus comparison through rigorous tests to determine how effective each program is at detecting wellknown malware and emerging zeroday viruses The very best programs scored 100 percent in both known and emerging malware protection Look for antivirus software with high scores as these programs are capable of defending you and your business against malicious threats 

    Features One of the main elements that separates antivirus software that can serve your business needs from programs that leave you wanting more is the security feature set If your business constantly sends email to external clients look for software that offers email protection a feature that scans incoming email for malware If hardware security is a concern look for programs that are capable of locating lost or stolen mobile devices such as laptops tablets and phones Some programs allow you to lock or wipe the content off laptops remotely which is a great feature that protects you against the theft of proprietary information contained on the laptop 

    Another element to strongly consider is which operating systems the antivirus software can protect Every small business antivirus software program we reviewed is capable of protecting PCs but only some programs can protect Macs or tablets If you need to use Windows or Linux servers make sure the software you purchase is capable of defending these systems from malware 

    Antivirus software is a necessity in todays business world Over 200000 new malware cases appear on a daily basis meaning every single day there are new ways your business is at risk of falling victim to a malware attack A lack of computer security can halt even the strongest businesses in its tracks Even large corporations suffer from malware attacks which always catches the attention of the media Most attacks against corporations are targeted attacks meaning a person or group of people is specifically trying to harm that entity via malware Fortunately for you most small businesses are only at risk for untargeted threats The best way to protect your small business from hacking or malicious viruses is to find the right antivirus software for your company This will allow you to rest easy 

    In July 2015 Microsoft released the latest version of its operating system Windows 10 As mentioned earlier Windows 10 comes with Windows Defender as a builtin antivirus and it offers a decent level of protection until you choose to install a thirdparty antivirus Most Windows 8 antivirus solutions work on Windows 10 so you shouldnt have problems getting the software to work properly AVTest evaluated 20 Windows 10 antivirus products in September and October of 2015 The tests concluded with four products earning perfect scores Bitdefender Kaspersky Norton and Avira 

    With the release of Windows 8 Windows Defender replaced Microsoft Security Essentials as the baseline of malware protection Although Microsoft continually updates and improves upon Windows Defender this security system does not perform as well as thirdparty Windows 8 antivirus programs According to the German software test lab AVTest the products we reviewed performed rather well compared to Defender demonstrating unusual strengths in intercepting malware while not being too strenuous on the overall system performance 

    Performance The tests Windows 8 antivirus software underwent are broken into two categories zeroday new threats and widespread known threats The industryaverage detection rating of brandnew viruses is 97 percent This means that thirdparty antivirus software is capable of catching most and in some cases all of these new and unknown viruses which is amazing 

    Defender however only averaged 73percent detection which is significantly lower than the industry standard During the tests against widespread and known malware thirdparty programs were capable of detecting 99 percent of all the viruses sent their way while Defender was only capable of detecting 74 percent of these viruses What this means is the very best virus protection for Windows 8 is found in the software we reviewed rather than Windows Defender The ability to detect malware is the most important component for any antivirus program so performance was highly weighted in our ranking process 

    Another element to consider when looking for the best antimalware software is how impactful each program is on your computer AVTest measured the effects each program had on Windows 8 during visits to websites and downloads through these tests they found the industry average was three seconds The very best antivirus software for Windows 8 had no effect on the overall system performance while Windows Defender slowed the system by five seconds 

    However Defender performed better than any other antivirus program when it came to false labeling of nonthreatening files as malicious viruses This is in part due to the fact that Defender takes slightly longer and uses more resources During a test of 525920 safe file samples Defender only mislabeled one sample as a threat The industry average for false labeling is six detections according to AVTests results Although Defender does a great job identifying safe samples it doesnt make up for the fact that it misses a higher percentage of unsafe samples 

    Features Every single program we considered for Windows 8 is capable of detecting spyware worms Trojans rootkits and other types of malware All of them are also capable of scanning incoming email and even instant messages for potential threats both of which are major mediums of attack for virus bots and hackers Additionally every single program we considered can automatically clean infected files without any required action from you as well as store infected files in a quarantine so that they do not infect your entire system Although every program is capable of performing all of these functions there are a number of defining factors for you to consider in order to find the right software for your needs 

    For example only a few antivirus programs for Windows 8 are capable of creating a rescue disk that allows you to reboot a computer that has crashed because of an infection Good antivirus software for Windows 8 automatically scans connected USB storage devices such as flash drives to help defend your computer from attacks Some antivirus software even includes password managers which help you create and store strong passwords These capabilities define the toprated antivirus programs on the market 

    Based on our evaluations of the best antivirus software for Windows 8 we found that Bitdefender Kaspersky and Norton achieved the best AVTest results and have plenty of features to cover your security needs All three of these programs scored 100 percent for the ability to protect against brandnew and old established malware which is impressive Bitdefender and Kaspersky were also scored 100 percent in tests that measure system impact and falsepositive detections meaning they wont slow down your overall computer performance at all and the programs wont mislabel safe files as potential threats Overall these three programs achieve great test results and have full feature sets to protect you against virus attacks 

    Although the computer protections set in place by Microsoft may tempt you to avoid purchasing thirdparty antivirus software you should know that these protections are best used as a starting point Even though Microsoft continually improves upon its builtin security systems with each installment of Windows builtin security getting better and better thirdparty applications simply outperform Microsoft Security Essentials These builtin protections are designed for users who either try to get by without additional security software or dont realize other software is needed However narrowing down the best antivirus for Windows 7 for your needs can seem like a daunting process We evaluated the top performers and ranked them based on their strengths and weaknesses to help you determine the right program for you 

    Performance Of course the most important thing to consider when you search for the right security software is its ability to defend your computer against attacks AVTest a wellrespected independent test lab tested every product we reviewed and published their findings This lab evaluated the protection capabilities of each product by testing it against both brandnew threats and wellknown established malware By exposing hundreds of workstations networked to dozens of servers to tens of millions of threats AVTest is capable of determining which programs can keep your system safe quite accurately Therefore the performance of each Windows 7 antivirus software was the most important element we used to determine our antivirus ratings 

    Features The next thing we considered for Windows 7 antivirus protection was the softwares feature set Generally speaking the more features an antivirus program has the more you can customize the security level of your computer system All antivirus software for Windows 7 is capable of detecting the different types of malware including Trojans spyware worms and rootkits and they can all automatically clean infected files scan compressed files and quarantine threats Differences between these products emerge in the form of more advanced features including the ability to protect computers from attacks that occur when you turn the computer on registry startup create bootable rescue disks and scan USB storage devices While you hunt for the right Windows 7 virus protection look for software that includes a number of additional features that can help you protect your system from nasty viruses 

    Although Microsoft Security Essentials offers some protection for your Windows 7 computer even the least effective thirdparty antivirus programs outperform the builtin security protections Microsoft Security Essentials is best used as a temporary line of defense while you find the antivirus software that will serve your needs best We found that Bitdefender Kaspersky and Norton were the best options for Windows 7 antivirus protection 

    The main goal behind the creation of Windows Vista was to improve the security of the Windows operating system after criticisms of its predecessors security vulnerabilities Despite the security improvements developed specifically for Vista advanced malware was created to break or circumnavigate the security systems in place 

    Even though Microsoft designed Vista with the intent to make it inherently secure thirdparty antispyware software is the best measure against attack from malware The best Windows Vista antivirus software allows you to rest easy and know that your system is safe from potential threats However finding the right Vista antivirus program can be a tricky and difficult process We evaluated and narrowed down the top choices through the following criteria to help keep your system safe 

    Performance All Windows Vista security programs are capable of detecting different types of malware including basic viruses and aggressive rootkits The main difference between these products is not if they can find and remove malware but how good they are at detecting these threats AVTest an independent antivirus test lab evaluates the best antivirus software programs on the market and runs them through rigorous tests to determine each programs ability to detect both brandnew and older malware So while youre looking for the best Vista antivirus software check out the performance scores of each program to make sure it is capable of catching brandnew threats as well as established malware The best software is capable of scoring 99 or even 100 percent in protection so pay special attention to these programs 

    Features All the antivirus software we reviewed for Windows Vista offers email protection automatically cleans infected files scans instant messages and quarantines dangerous files so they cant spread to other files However only some of these programs can create bootable rescue disks that allow you to recover a computer that has been infected which can be incredibly helpful Additionally not every program protects against attacks via USB storage devices or has antiphishing securities in place Make sure to look for programs that meet all of your needs before making your final decision 

    Another element to consider when looking for antivirus software is how impactful the program is on the host operating system The top antivirus programs have no impact on the system performance meaning you can visit webpages download files use different applications and so on without any performance interference from the antimalware program However most programs have at least some effect on the systems performance generally a slowdown of around three seconds which isnt terrible but is still noticeable 

    Even with enhanced security in place with Windows Vista antivirus software allows you to rest easy This software can give you all the protection you need As new malware appears every single day antivirus software evolves to help you stay on top of these growing threats Antivirus software for Windows Vista will help your system remain safe against these constant and everchanging threats 

    Windows XP was a revolutionary operating system for Microsoft that generated an overwhelming level of popularity from the general public and businesses alike XP proved to be intuitive highly capable and the most popular operating system from Microsoft for about 10 years even after the release of Windows Vista and 7 Now that Microsoft has ceased updating support and security updates to Windows XP protection against malware is vital if you want your computer to continue running smoothly Without Windows XP antivirus software you are at higher risk than most users and your computer can become completely unusable in a short period of time To help you narrow down the best antivirus software for your needs we ranked the top 10 antivirus software based on the following criteria 

    Performance The first thing to consider for any antivirus software is its capability to detect and remove malware Not all programs are created equal and some software is better at defending your system against potential threats AVTest an independent software test lab evaluates antivirus software for Windows XP on the effectiveness or in some cases the ineffectiveness of virus protection programs on the market today 

    The very best antivirus software is capable of detecting and removing 100 percent of the threats sent its way Many programs perform decently catching 96 or 97 percent of the malware AVTest sends its way Regardless make sure the antivirus software you purchase for Windows XP can catch and remove a high percentage of threats so you know your system is safe 

    System Usage The next great differentiator between Windows XP virus protection programs comes down to how systemintensive the software is on your computer If you still run Windows XP a major factor in your decision will be the power of your processor If you have a relatively new computer with decent specs you can purchase virtually any antivirus software on the market without having to worry about system performance However if you are looking for antivirus software for an older machine the processing power required to run antimalware programs effectively can be a concern If you have limited RAM or processing speed consider an antivirus program that doesnt take a large toll on the system 

    Regardless of whether your Windows XP hardware is relatively new or rather old its still a good idea to look for programs that are not as resourceintensive during updates scans or malware removal just to be safe Generally speaking the older your computer gets the more ineffective it will be at running new software such as antivirus software which is constantly updating 

    To help you determine whether or not an antivirus program is capable of running on your computer or not weve included the minimum system requirements of Windows XP antivirus software to help you find a program that will work on your machine 

    Features Every program we evaluated is capable of detecting numerous types of malware including spyware rootkits and basic viruses What separates the best antivirus software from the others are additional features that offer more protective techniques to combat malware attacks For example many programs offer the ability to create a backup recovery disk so that you can recover your computer after it has been infected 

    Other programs are capable of performing vulnerability scans in which the antimalware program searches for outdated programs on your computer to see if it can find any weaknesses for malware to pass through Finally the best antivirus software for Windows XP can launch a virtual browser allowing you to run websites separate from your computer system to check it for vulnerabilities You may not need all of these features for your personal use but make sure the software you purchase can handle all of your needs 

    This is a nonexhaustive list of notable antivirus and Internet Security software in the form of comparison tables according to their platform eg desktop and server mobile etc and their operating systems eg Windows OS X Linux Solaris Android iOS Ubuntu Touch Windows Phone etc 

    The term ondemand scan refers to the possibility of performing a manual scan by the user on the entire computerdevice while onaccess scan refers to the ability of a product to automatically scan every file at its creation andor subsequent modification 

    Once upon a time Apple even used the lack of viruses as a marketing tool to sell more Macs In a company marketing web page titled Why Youll Love a Mac no longer exists the language was once quite clear Apples OS X doesnt get PC viruses Somewhere around 2012 that message changed to Its built to be safe The update itself happened shortly after nearly 600000 Macs were infected with a trojan named Flashback and although this wasnt the first time Macs were targeted it was certainly the largest This security breach led Apple and Mac users to understand that they were in no means immune to viruses or malware 

    While large scale viruses are still a rarity among Mac users that doesnt lessen the need for smart antivirus software in order to help you recognize and react to possible infections Here are five smart and free choices to keep your machine free from viruses and malware 

    Sophos Antivirus features an easy to use interface that can be used for custom ondemand scanning as well as fully automated scans at userdefined intervals The software runs quietly in the background and is surprisingly resource friendly so it doesnt slow down your system as much as some other options With the Live Antivirus feature Sophos even updates your software the moment that new threats are found online and through use of the link scanner its now possible to perform full scans on web pages before you click the link to visit 

    In a headtohead test of several popular free and paid options for Mac Sophos was the clear cut winner and one of only two to achieve a perfect 100percent in catching all malware it was tested against with zero false positives 

    Avast is widely considered the best or near the top in terms of free Windows antivirus software For the Mac the system certainly doesnt disappoint and its definitely on par with the top choice Sophos The one major drawback to Avast on Mac is that it only scans for Macspecific malware which is fine if you never use a Windowsbased PC but becomes problematic in terms of email and file sharing when youre sharing these files outside of a Macbased ecosystem As far as security on a Mac though Avast is about as good as they come In fact AV Comparatives tested Avast and found that it detected 100percent of the malware that they attempted to download to the system which makes it the only other Mac antivirus software with that distinction Sophos is the other 

    ClamXav 2 uses the open source ClamAV virus scanning engine to scan for both Windows and OS X malware viruses and badware ClamXav is actually the most lightweight free antivirus software in our recommendations and its compatible with any Mac running OS X 105 or higher 

    Comodo is an extremely powerful antivirus software but its strongest point also makes it a relatively unpopular option outside of the website administrator crowd While its scoring on malware blocking tests and built in sandbox for opening packages and files from unknown sources makes it a very safe and secure utility the nuts and bolts of the program are decidedly expertonly and better left to those who really know that theyre doing 

    As far as an outofthebox option Comodo is powerful but it had relatively poor scores in blocking malicious URLs the rate of false positives is high identifying safe software as malware and the previously mentioned sandbox tool makes it a real pain to install some legit software For example when installing Sketch 3 I had a heck of a time getting the antivirus to understand that the package was safe and that I did indeed want to move it to my Applications folder 

    Avira is a utility that was once according to AV Comparative testing on par with Sophos and Avast in the sense that it caught 100percent of malware tested In the latest test it caught 91percent making it an admirable contender but putting it in the decidedly second tier category of some lesserknowns such as ClamXav 2 That said Avira is by far the most user friendly of any of the antivirus programs tested and it would make a perfect addition for the nontech demographic such as your parents or grandparents 

    As far as what that means for you well it really depends on what youre looking for Each application offers different benefits so your best bet is to determine what type of user you are and begin testing the options from there

Actually this is my first time to use by my own self but avira is also my anti virus before but shamed to say that my comp is always taking care of my EX his the one who do it for all my comp or More    Protecting your PC or Mac from a virus is easy with internet security software  but deciding which package to install isnt We have expert advice on picking out the best antivirus suite and tell you whether free antivirus is worth considering 

    The internet is full of threats but thats no reason not to enjoy the best of the web  the key is keeping your Mac or PC properly protected with an internet security package Viruses and malware can infect your computer in several ways but the best antivirus software will give you peace of mind that your computer and personal data are safe 

    Most people keep their computer safe by buying a security suite which will usually include antivirus antispyware software and a firewall Your security package should cost from 3050 and usually includes a years subscription to software updates to keep it uptodate with details about the latest threats 

    The best security software suites come with extra features such as parental controls maintenance and backup and recovery tools that can help you restore your computer in the event of a disaster Generally they also have better customer and technical support than free internet security 

    Pros Provides an allround antivirus antispyware and firewall solution accessed through a single interface Individual components are automatically updated at the same time so you get protection against the latest threats 

    Cons They can be expensive  from 3050 and youll also face ongoing costs usually in the form of an annual subscription in order to receive updates after the initial period of protection is over usually a year Some security suites can place a huge drain on system resources too potentially slowing down your computers operation 

    Alternatively you can download free antivirus tools from the internet that provide a good level of protection And its possible to get most of the features supplied by paidfor internet security by using a combination of free antivirus downloads though they wont be packaged up neatly in one place and you can risk compatibility problems 

    Pros You can use your chosen antivirus antispyware antispam and firewall programs in tandem to completely protect your PC or Mac without spending a penny And because theyre free you can try out different packages before settling on the one for you 

    Cons They provide only a basic level of protection and lack the extra features of paidfor security software Youll have to keep each individual program updated to ensure youre protected against the latest threats Plus free antivirus software is typically singleuser so youll need to download install and manage a separate version if you have more than one computer 

    The biggest shakeup in PC security for years came with Microsofts launch of Windows 8 Unlike previous versions it came with lots of security features baked right into the operating system and Which found Windows 8 to be very secure in our tests 

    Weve yet to test out Windows 10 security in our test lab but we expect it to include similar security provisions as Windows 8 One of the key changes for Windows 8 was the replacement of Microsoft Security Essentials with Windows Defender Defender has been beefed up to include antivirus protection along with antispyware features It runs in the background and notifies you when you need to take action 

    Windows 8 and 10 users are further protected by a twoway firewall that monitors the information going back and forth to the internet Other features include a SmartScreen filter to help protect against phishing scams plus parental controls to monitor childrens activities online Windows 8 and Windows 10 both include a Secure Boot option that prevents malware from gaining a foothold on your PC during startup 

    Pros We found that Microsoft Windows 8 has strong builtin security and antivirus features and we fully expect Windows 10 to continue this trend Which has found that this means you dont need to use additional security software if youre running Windows 8  well know soon if the same is true on Windows 10 

    Cons Because of the sheer amount of Windows users Microsofts operating system is frequently made the target of hackers and creators of viruses PC users with versions of Windows prior to Windows 8 should certainly seek to install separate security software 

    Despite their reputation for being more secure than Windows PCs Apple Mac computers are not immune from viruses and malware With more Apple products being sold the target audience for hackers is becoming more attractive This makes it more likely that viruses will be designed specifically to attack Macs so it makes sense to think about Mac security software 

    Apple continues to boost security in each new version of the Mac OS X operating system But Macs do not include antivirus or antispyware software although they do have a builtin firewall to block attacks from malicious users online Theres plenty of paidfor and free security software for the Mac to choose from 

    Cons Perhaps due to Apples reputation for being less susceptible to malware there arent a huge amount of security packages available  and those we have tested have on average scored worse than antivirus suites for Windows 

    Theres a long standing adage that using two antivirus products is a bad idea because they can cause glitches with two programs trying to perform the same task Limiting yourself to one internet security program also minimises the impact of AV software on the performance of your PC 

    Pros Weve seen some security software that usefully bolster the malware fighting elements of your main antivirus package Malwarebytes AntiMalware for example is a standalone security tool that can be installed alongside your regular security software  and it has a brilliant track record for vanquishing virtual nasties Plus its free 

    ClamWin Free Antivirus for 2012 build 0973 is designed for Windows and uses the open source GNU General Public License The antivirus program currently supports the following operating systems Microsoft Windows 98 ME XP 2003 and Vista 

    The features you can expect to find in ClamWin Free AntiVirus 2012 are virus database updates which the program retrieves automatically rightclick menu MS Windows Explorer integration scanning scheduler a standalone virus scanner and addin function to MS Outlook which enables easy scanning of email attachments New for 2012 is its Quarantine Browser which offers the option to restore quarantined files later proven to be a false positive a verification process for digital signatures to minimize false positives along with several known bug fixes and protection enhancements  

    One of the downsides to ClamWin Free AntiVirus is that it doesnt have an automatic scanning feature for newly activated files This means that youll have to manually scan all the files you have recently downloaded from the web before you can safely execute or use the files 

    What ClamWin Free AntiVirus does have however is an update feature that ensures that your software application is equipped with protection methods to prevent your computer from getting infected with the latest viruses worms and other types of malware ClamWin Free AntiVirus also has a comprehensive online database that is automatically refreshed several times every 24 hours The new 2012 improves on it virus signature matching at the byte code level signature matching Like most other antivirus programs ClamWin Free AntiVirus also has a scanner scheduler that allows you to customize the exact times of the day when you want your system to be scanned Another cool feature of the ClamWin Free AntiVirus database is its availability in a portable version which users can store and use from a USB universal serial bus flash drive 

    ClamWin Free AntiVirus uses the open source GNU General Public License Because of this the program comes with an open source code and an installer that you also get at no cost ClamWin Free AntiVirus can be installed silently  you can install the software application without interacting directly with the program This means no user prompts no text confirmations and no dialog boxes 

    The downloaded installer allows you to integrate the software with Internet Explorer and also choose to install the Outlook module It then lends an icon on your Windows tray which when rightclicked opens the ClamWin configuration page for scheduling scans manually checking on updates and displaying reports among others  

    ClamWin Free AntiVirus has a graphical user interface that is relatively easy to use The main user interface is downright basic and uncluttered with a simple tree view for choosing your drives and folders to scan But the simplicity betrays an efficiency that is par for the course among free antivirus software Launching Outlook opened ClamWin with it as an addon ribbon that works in the background to detect and identify infected incoming messages You can easily jump from tab to tab to go to the specific function you wish to tweak or execute If you want to conduct more thorough scans you can use the rightclick feature to select the specific files directories and locations that you want to scan 

    Although ClamWin lacks the ondemand scanning option and other uptodate functions found in other free antivirus programs its still a good option for those who want to keep their computers safe from viruses without spending a dime

    Thats why our experts pride themselves in bringing you updated simple information about the top anti virus software available on the market You might have noticed that the same brands are dominant  but thats only because they have been tried and tested for years To be fair we also included other contenders like Avira Eset and Trend Micro 

     avast is an antivirus set that is able to detect the presence of viruses in computers It has a powerful antivirus kernal that has a boottime scan improved resident protection heuristic analysis for email and a script blocker The program works great as a ondemand andor resident virus scanner The skinable interface is easy to use for any user  

This software used to be better Too many false positives and no support unless you pay Fresh installs of Wordpress are blocked because of HTMLScriptinf Then Avasts asks to upgrade for more protection    It gets a 1 star because it wouldnt let me go to a jailbreak link I know is fine then I uninstalled Avast it tells me to reboot to finish uninstalling only for Windows 8 to refuse to boot up again due to a missing file Now I get to spend hours reinstalling Windows and everything and lost data over it Thanks Avast not I should add if you check the av comparative website Avast has far more false positives than any of the other software they test much higher not just a few files difference 

    Hi guys  newbe here I have been using Avast 48 professional for yonks 481335 expiry 2018 and have found it elstupendo Whats not documented about THIS edition is that when you run Malwarebytes manually it handshakes with avast and they BOTH examine the files Whats annoying lately is that although this is a legal registered and paid for edition I have been getting these daily pop ups from Avast telling me my free edition is about to run out so register now Firstly I dont have a free edition and it IS registered I confirmed this by reregistering it and Avast sez OK carry on The a day later  almost exactly this stupid pop up appears again It has not effected my upgrades nor any functionality at all but it is getting to be a pain having to just close the pop up and ignore it What in the sam hill is causing this to happen AND regularly by time clock every 24 hours no sooner or later
PS my system clock and date is correct 

    The AntiVir Guard is constantly working in the background and checks every file as it is used by Windows or other software This includes heuristic scanning to check for viruses that have not been formally identified 

     AVG is a big name in AV with its free software offering a basic level of protection We chose to evaluate this over the paidfor software because its the most popular version Internet Security 2015 is the paidfor service and includes additional features that could potentially improve its results including Cloudbased file scanning which analyses files before theyre ever downloaded to your computer 

    Last year we were irritated by AVGs rather overt advertising tactics with banners and popups encouraging us to upgrade The banner is still there ever present in all parts of the software but is far less garish Theres a tool for cleaning junk from your PC The analysis tool is part of the free package but youll need separate paidfor PC TuneUp software in order to solve any issues 

    Protection scores have improved remarkably since our last set of tests with AVG managing an overall score of 93 in our most recent round of tests Unfortunately in a super competitive round of tests 93 puts AVG thirdfromlast and a fair way behind free antivirus leader Avast When subjected to 100 attacks AVG faultlessly defendined against 57 A further 36 were able to run on our test system but AVG neutralised them before they were able to do any damage Slightly worryingly seven threats made it through untouched and were allowed to wreak havoc on our test PC  

    There are plenty of options that at first glance have no explanation but AVG has included an extensive offline help file that can be accessed from any part of the settings menus and youll be taken to the page explaining that particular function Its a useful addition particularly for less experienced users 

    AVG is a great piece of software just slightly let down by its protection scores Considering its taken massive strides in improving its scores however we wouldnt be surprised if it became a front runner in future tests For now though wed recommend Avast Free Anti Virus as your top choice of free protection 

    Today an antivirus is a must install piece of software to protect your computer against online threats Although there are no antivirus applications that can guarantee 100 protection all the time it can offer a high level of protection up to more than 90 depending on the type of antivirus software that you use There are quite a few brands that develop antivirus software and they dont all have the same capability It is generally safe to say that a good antivirus is one that is most being used such as AVAST which is currently the most downloaded software in CNETs Downloadcom followed by AVG 

    Well be taking a look at a lesser known piece of antivirus software called FortiClient developed by Fortinet a company that specializes in network security hardware products There used to be 2 different versions of FortiClient which is the paid Standard and the free Lite version However in the current version 5 theyve dropped the different versions and made the single FortiClient free 

    Basically the main features found in FortiClient are the real time antivirus with advanced heuristics a web security module which protects you against certain types of websites by category and a VPN Remote Access which is mostly not used by home users adsbygoogle  windowadsbygoogle  push The firewall module has been dropped from FortiClient 

    FortiClient has been consistently awarded from AVComparatives since 2012 and they recently received an ADVANCED which is the highest rating in the file detection test Other than that FortiClient successfully blocked 99 on the April 2015 realworld protection test beating other popular competitors such as AVG BullGuard Emsisoft Lavasoft McAfee Quick Heal Sophos and Vipre 

    VB100 is the most well known comparison test performed by Virus Bulletin FortiClient has earned 9 out of 10 VB100 award in the last 12 tests with 2 tests not entered In fact the full test history shows very clearly that FortiClient did quite badly in the beginning and it got better with only 2 fail out of 22 tests since June 2010 

    PCSL is a company from China consisting of a team of passionate testers and researchers They have conducted many different types of tests such as cleaning test android malware detection test desktop browser performance review exploit mitigations test and etc 

    The Desktop Malware Detection Test conducted on December 2014 has FortiClient included in the report and it achieved 2nd place with 99903 detection and 0 false positives missing merely 20 samples out of 20552 

    A summary of 5 enterprise products being tested by NSS Labs dated back in 2014 shows that FortiClient successfully achieved a 998 block rate with 994 blocked on download and 04 blocked on execution This figure puts FortiClient in the 2nd place in par with Bitdefender while the first place is taken by Symantec 

    Weve also performed a very simple and quick test to see the effectiveness of FortiClient in blockingdetecting new malware samples Weve downloaded 10 latest samples from VX Vault and FortiClient instantly detected 6 out of 10 As for the remaining 4 samples they were successfully blocked from downloading to the computer by the Web Security module 

    The second major feature found in FortiClient that makes it even better is the Web Security module which acts as a web filter It has 6 different main site categories and each category expands to a more specific type of websites 

    You can easily change the configuration either to allow block warn or monitor by clicking on the icon and select the appropriate command A specific website can be added to the exclusion list if there is a need to access it but is in a blocked category 

    There is not much configuration found in FortiClient and most settings can be left at the default There is a backuprestore configuration logging enabling VPN before logon using local certificate uploads enabling detection for programs that belong in the grayware category such as an Adware and Riskware and etc Do take note that the Enable WAN Optimization option will only work if you are connected to a network with a FortiGate device configured for WAN optimization Most of the time this option is not needed at home 

    Another useful feature is the ability to lock FortiClient with a password to prevent from pausing the protection or closing the program The settings are also protected and cannot be changed when the configuration changes is locked 

    With a quick glance in terms of performance FortiClient creates 9 background processes and taking up less than 20MB of memory usage on Windows startup The memory usage does not increase much when the computer is idle and only goes up when there is activity such as scanning a file A slightly dated performance test by AVComparatives shows that FortiClient offers better performance than the out of box system impact with Microsoft Windows Defender enabled on Windows 81 

    Closing Words FortiClient offers very good protection against malicious software and a superior web filter for free The only thing is we couldnt get confirmation from Fortinet if the free FortiClient can be used commercially FortiClient is definitely a good alternative to other free antivirus software such as Avast AVG Avira etc 

    As I just said in a comment under your List of Free Antivirus for Commercial Use it can based on what a Fortinet guy said in their forum For the record I am not affiliated with Fortinet in any way I am a SOHO user looking for a free AV for a couple of my PCs and thats how I found your site and then Fortinet forum 

    When it comes to free antivirus for Windows computer your friends will mostly recommend you either Avast Free Antivirus 2015 or AVG AntiVirus FREE 2016 But which one of them is the best Both are completely for free and offers plenty of advanced feature Well take a look in details 

    Both Avast and AVG are offering a solid protection against viruses spyware malware and rootkids Plus you will be secured while browsing online chatting on Facebook or watching videos on YouTube Also they will protect and scan your incoming and outgoing emails if you are using email client like Outlook or Thunderbird If youre a gamer you can relax  both antivirus solutions offers smart gaming mode and keep themselves silent 

    With Avast you will get some cool features like Home Network Security which scans your home network WiFi connection and routers Easytouse tool called Browser Cleanup for removing unwanted toolbars from your browser Software Updater for monitoring the uptodate status of the other software like browser Java Adobe Reader etc And you can ask your IT friend to fix your computer via the secured remote connection 

    However there are some differences AVG offers spying and data theft protection controlling what kind of data you are sharing with the other applications and File Shredder which can permanently delete your sensitive information so they cant be restored Similar feature called Data Shredder is available also in Avast but only in the toptier product Avast Premier not in the free one 

    Big plus for AVG is that you dont need to register or give out any personal information You can just download install and keep using it With Avast you have to register name and email within the first 30 days and then once a year 

    In the boot time test where less is better it took only 28 seconds in average to load Windows desktop when Avast Free Antivirus was installed Same operation took 33 seconds in average when AVG AntiVirus FREE was installed Default boottime without any antivirus solution in place took 20 seconds So according to our testing Windows loads faster with Avast 

    Final performance test results are highlighted on the chart below You can clearly see the difference between no antivirus and Avast or AVG present Please note the vertical axis Performance Score is not starting from 0 but from 2110 to clearly show the small differences 

    Avast user interface is really nice and clear The main four tiles shows the the most popular tools which you can run on a singleclick You can also change the tiles and select what featuresscans you want to list on the main page The green button UPGRADE leads to comparison table of Avast Free Antivirus and Avast premium products 

    The status is also indicated by color when green obviously means You are protected note AVG is using the exactly same term Also you are assured that All shields are active and Everything is uptodate The menu on the left side on the other hand could be more easier to read and contain less items Items like Store Account and Statistics are rather additional and not that important 

    AVG user interface is quite busy compared to Avast When everything is fine you will see green tick marks with the message You are protected The interface will go red if there will be some issue What is nice is when some of the shields are disabled you will see immediately which ones as they will also turn in red 

    The main tiles shows you the status of the specific shield protection If you are looking for scan its the less visible button Scan now The Fix performance button sounds pretty interesting but you need to download other product AVG PC TuneUp to actually fix the performance Last button is for checking if the program is uptodate of course the virus definitions are updated automatically Join us on Facebook link at the top bar is very visible and somehow distracting

    The better product is the most users it has Its simple as that However its not easy to say which is most popular antivirus if Avast or AVG For expressing popularity we are using several publicly accessible methods 

    According to official website Avast is protecting more than 230 million users worldwide AVG claims on their homepage to have more than 200 million users worldwide in November 2015 Based on these reliable claims Avast has more users than AVG 

    OPSWAT is regularly releasing reports about the antivirus market share Data are based on the OPSWAT GEARS software installed on the client machines According to the latest report from January 2015 Avast is dominating the worldwide market with 214 Closely followed by Microsoft with their Security Essentials and 194 AVG is at the third place with only 86 

    Downloadcom by CNET is the Worlds most popular download portal According to its popularity rankings AVG has more total downloads  almost 539 million while Avast has only 347 million However the recent trend shows Avast is slightly more popular as it leads the last week downloads number 

    Another way how to measure productcompany popularity is by the number of fansfollowers on social media networks like Facebook and Twitter Avast is leading on Facebook with almost 44 million fans vs AVGs 32 million On Twitter the leader is AVG with 220k followers vs Avasts 161k 

    Respected computer magazine PCMag gives AVG AntiVirus FREE better rating than Avast Free Antivirus in their comprehensive comparison of free antivirus solutions Actually AVG is their choice 1 with 455 rating and Editors Choice award 

    Both products will run on majority of todays computers as there are no special requirements You just need to run a newer Windows than 2000 so at least Windows XP with Service Pack 2 Both Avast and AVG are also fully compatible with the latest Windows 10 

    Although the requirements are very similar there are some small differences Avast will run on a slower computer Intel Pentium III with 128 MB RAM but needs quite a lot of space on hard drive 2 GB AVG needs faster computer Intel Pentium 15 GHz with 512 MB RAM but takes less space on hard drive 12 GB 

    Both products have their pros and cons We dont want to recommend only one of them instead we would like to encourage you to try both and see if Avast or AVG will suit you better Even they are offered completely for free the level of protection you will get is comparable with the paidfor antivirus solutions The download links are below 

    Information about the product features have been obtained from the official websites of each vendor If you believe we have stated something not correct please let us know and well fix it immediately Our intention is to offer the fair and factbased comparison of each product
